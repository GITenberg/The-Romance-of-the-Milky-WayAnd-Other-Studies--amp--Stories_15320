    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

    <p>Lafcadio Hearn, known to Nippon as Yakumo Koizumi, was born
    in Leucadia in the Ionian Islands, June 27, 1850. His father
    was an Irish surgeon in the British Army; his mother was a
    Greek. Both parents died while Hearn was still a child, and he
    was adopted by a great-aunt, and educated for the priesthood.
    To this training he owed his Latin scholarship and, doubtless,
    something of the subtlety of his intelligence. He soon found,
    however, that the prospect of an ecclesiastical career was
    alien from his inquiring mind and vivid temperament, and at the
    age of nineteen he came to America to seek his fortune. After
    working for a time as a proof-reader, he obtained employment as
    a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati. Soon he rose to be an
    editorial writer, and went in the course of a few years to New
    Orleans to join the editorial staff of the "Times-Democrat."
    Here he lived until 1887, writing odd fantasies and arabesques
    for his paper, contributing articles and sketches
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"
       id="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span> to the magazines, and
       publishing several curious little books, among them his
       "Stray Leaves from Strange Literature," and his translations
       from Gautier. In the winter of 1887 he began his pilgrimages
       to exotic countries, being, as he wrote to a friend, "a
       small literary bee in search of inspiring honey." After a
       couple of years, spent chiefly in the French West Indies,
       with periods of literary work in New York, he went in 1890
       to Japan to prepare a series of articles for a magazine.
       Here through some deep affinity of mood with the marvelous
       people of that country he seems suddenly to have felt
       himself at last at home. He married a Japanese woman; he
       acquired Japanese citizenship in order to preserve the
       succession of his property to his family there; he became a
       lecturer in the Imperial University at T&#333;ky&#333;; and
       in a series of remarkable books he made himself the
       interpreter to the Western World of the very spirit of
       Japanese life and art. He died there of paralysis of the
       heart on the 26th of September, 1904.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>With the exception of a body of familiar letters now in
    process of collection, the present volume contains all of
    Hearn's writing <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix"
       id="pageix"></a>[pg ix]</span> that he left uncollected in
       the magazines or in manuscript of a sufficient ripeness for
       publication. It is worth noting, however, that perfect as is
       the writing of "Ultimate Questions," and complete as the
       essay is in itself, the author regarded it as unfinished,
       and, had he lived, would have revised and amplified some
       portions of it.</p>

    <p>But if this volume lacks the incomparably exquisite touch of
    its author in its arrangement and revision, it does,
    nevertheless, present him in all of his most characteristic
    veins, and it is in respect both to style and to substance
    perhaps the most mature and significant of his works.</p>

    <p>In his first days as a writer Hearn had conceived an ideal
    of his art as specific as it was ambitious. Early in the
    eighties he wrote from New Orleans in an unpublished letter to
    the Rev. Wayland D. Ball of Washington: "The lovers of antique
    loveliness are proving to me the future possibilities of a long
    cherished dream,&mdash;the English realization of a Latin
    style, modeled upon foreign masters, and rendered even more
    forcible by that element of <i>strength</i> which is the
    characteristic of Northern tongues. This no man can hope to
    accomplish, but even a translator
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"
       id="pagex"></a>[pg x]</span> may carry his stones to the
       master-masons of a new architecture of language." In the
       realization of his ideal Hearn took unremitting pains. He
       gave a minute and analytical study to the writings of such
       masters of style as Flaubert and Gautier, and he chose his
       miscellaneous reading with a peculiar care. He wrote again
       to the same friend: "I never read a book which does not
       powerfully impress the imagination; but whatever contains
       novel, curious, potent imagery I always read, no matter what
       the subject. When the soil of fancy is really well enriched
       with innumerable fallen leaves, the flowers of language grow
       spontaneously." Finally, to the hard study of technique, to
       vast but judicious reading, he added a long, creative
       brooding time. To a Japanese friend, Nobushige Amenomori, he
       wrote in a passage which contains by implication a deep
       theory not only of literary composition, but of all
       art:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Now with regard to your own sketch or story. If you are
    quite dissatisfied with it, I think this is probably due
    <i>not</i> to what you suppose,&mdash;imperfection of
    expression,&mdash;but rather to the fact that some
    <i>latent</i> thought or emotion has not yet defined itself in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi"
       id="pagexi"></a>[pg xi]</span> your mind with sufficient
       sharpness. You feel something and have not been able to
       express the feeling&mdash;only because you do not yet quite
       know what it is. We feel without understanding feeling; and
       our most powerful emotions are the most undefinable. This
       must be so, because they are inherited accumulations of
       feeling, and the multiplicity of them&mdash;superimposed one
       over another&mdash;blurs them, and makes them dim, even
       though enormously increasing their strength....
       <i>Unconscious</i> brain work is the best to develop such
       latent feeling or thought. By quietly writing the thing over
       and over again, I find that the emotion or idea often
       <i>develops itself</i> in the process,&mdash;unconsciously.
       Again, it is often worth while to <i>try</i> to analyze the
       feeling that remains dim. The effort of trying to understand
       exactly what it is that moves us sometimes proves
       successful.... If you have any feeling&mdash;no matter
       what&mdash;strongly latent in the mind (even only a haunting
       sadness or a mysterious joy), you may be sure that it is
       expressible. Some feelings are, of course, very difficult to
       develop. I shall show you one of these days, when we see
       each other, a page that I worked at for <i>months</i> before
       the idea came clearly.... When the best result comes, it
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii"
       id="pagexii"></a>[pg xii]</span> ought to surprise you, for
       our best work is out of the Unconscious."</p>

    <p>Through this study, reading, and brooding Lafcadio Hearn's
    prose ripened and mellowed consistently to the end. In mere
    workmanship the present volume is one of his most admirable,
    while in its heightened passages, like the final paragraph of
    "The Romance of the Milky Way," the rich, melancholy music, the
    profound suggestion, are not easily matched from any but the
    very greatest English prose.</p>

    <p>In substance the volume is equally significant. In 1884 he
    wrote to one of the closest of his friends that he had at last
    found his feet intellectually through the reading of Herbert
    Spencer which had dispelled all "isms" from his mind and left
    him "the vague but omnipotent consolation of the Great Doubt."
    And in "Ultimate Questions," which strikes, so to say, the
    dominant chord of this volume, we have an almost lyrical
    expression of the meaning for him of the Spencerian philosophy
    and psychology. In it is his characteristic mingling of
    Buddhist and Shinto thought with English and French psychology,
    strains which in his work "do not simply mix well," as he says
    in one of his letters, but "absolutely unite, like chemical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"
       id="pagexiii"></a>[pg xiii]</span> elements&mdash;rush
       together with a shock;"&mdash;and in it he strikes his
       deepest note. In his steady envisagement of the horror that
       envelops the stupendous universe of science, in his power to
       evoke and revive old myths and superstitions, and by their
       glamour to cast a ghostly light of vanished suns over the
       darkness of the abyss, he was the most Lucretian of modern
       writers.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In outward appearance Hearn, the man, was in no way
    prepossessing. In the sharply lined picture of him drawn by one
    of his Japanese comrades in the "Atlantic" for October, 1905,
    he appears, "slightly corpulent in later years, short in
    stature, hardly five feet high, of somewhat stooping gait. A
    little brownish in complexion, and of rather hairy skin. A
    thin, sharp, aquiline nose, large protruding eyes, of which the
    left was blind and the right very near-sighted."</p>

    <p>The same writer, Nobushige Amenomori, has set down a
    reminiscence, not of Hearn the man, but of Hearn the genius,
    wherewith this introduction to the last of his writings may
    fitly conclude: "I shall ever retain the vivid remembrance of
    the sight I had when I stayed over night at his house for the
    first time. Being <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv"
       id="pagexiv"></a>[pg xiv]</span> used myself also to sit up
       late, I read in bed that night. The clock struck one in the
       morning, but there was a light in Hearn's study. I heard
       some low, hoarse coughing. I was afraid my friend might be
       ill; so I stepped out of my room and went to his study. Not
       wanting, however, to disturb him, if he was at work, I
       cautiously opened the door just a little, and peeped in. I
       saw my friend intent in writing at his high desk, with his
       nose almost touching the paper. Leaf after leaf he wrote on.
       In a while he held up his head, and what did I see! It was
       not the Hearn I was familiar with; it was another Hearn. His
       face was mysteriously white; his large eye gleamed. He
       appeared like one in touch with some unearthly presence.</p>

    <p>"Within that homely looking man there burned something pure
    as the vestal fire, and in that flame dwelt a mind that called
    forth life and poetry out of dust, and grasped the highest
    themes of human thought."</p>

    <h2>THE ROMANCE, OF THE MILKY WAY</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Of old it was said: 'The River of Heaven is the Ghost of
        Waters.' We behold it shifting its bed in the course of the
        year as an earthly river sometimes does.</p>

        <p class="author"><i>Ancient Scholar</i></p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"
       id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>

    <p>Among the many charming festivals celebrated by Old Japan,
    the most romantic was the festival of Tanabata-Sama, the
    Weaving-Lady of the Milky Way. In the chief cities her holiday
    is now little observed; and in T&#333;ky&#333; it is almost
    forgotten. But in many country districts, and even in villages,
    near the capital, it is still celebrated in a small way. If you
    happen to visit an old-fashioned country town or village, on
    the seventh day of the seventh month (by the ancient calendar),
    you will probably notice many freshly-cut bamboos fixed upon
    the roofs of the houses, or planted in the ground beside them,
    every bamboo having attached to it a number of strips of
    colored <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> paper. In some very poor
       villages you might find that these papers are white, or of
       one color only; but the general rule is that the papers
       should be of five or seven different colors. Blue, green,
       red, yellow, and white are the tints commonly displayed. All
       these papers are inscribed with short poems written in
       praise of Tanabata and her husband Hikoboshi. After the
       festival the bamboos are taken down and thrown into the
       nearest stream, together with the poems attached to
       them.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>To understand the romance of this old festival, you must
    know the legend of those astral divinities to whom offerings
    used to be made, even by, the Imperial Household, on the
    seventh day of the seventh month. The legend is Chinese. This
    is the Japanese popular version of it:&mdash;</p>

    <p>The great god of the firmament had a lovely daughter,
    Tanabata-tsumé, who passed her days in weaving garments for her
    august parent. She rejoiced in her work, and thought that there
    was no greater pleasure than the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> pleasure of weaving. But one
       day, as she sat before her loom at the door of her heavenly
       dwelling, she saw a handsome peasant lad pass by, leading an
       ox, and she fell in love with him. Her august father,
       divining her secret wish, gave her the youth for a husband.
       But the wedded lovers became too fond of each other, and
       neglected their duty to the god of the firmament; the sound
       of the shuttle was no longer heard, and the ox wandered,
       unheeded, over the plains of heaven. Therefore the great god
       was displeased, and he separated the pair. They were
       sentenced to live thereafter apart, with the Celestial River
       between them; but it was permitted them to see each other
       once a year, on the seventh night of the seventh moon. On
       that night&mdash;providing the skies be clear&mdash;the
       birds of heaven make, with their bodies and wings, a bridge
       over the stream; and by means of that bridge the lovers can
       meet. But if there be rain, the River of Heaven rises, and
       becomes so wide that the bridge cannot be formed. So the
       husband and wife cannot always meet, even on the seventh
       night of the seventh <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> month; it may happen, by reason
       of bad weather, that they cannot meet for three or four
       years at a time. But their love remains immortally young and
       eternally patient; and they continue to fulfill their
       respective duties each day without fault,&mdash;happy in
       their hope of being able to meet on the seventh night of the
       next seventh month.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>To ancient Chinese fancy, the Milky Way was a luminous
    river,&mdash;the River of Heaven,&mdash;the Silver Stream. It
    has been stated by Western writers that Tanabata, the
    Weaving-Lady, is a star in Lyra; and the Herdsman, her beloved,
    a star in Aquila, on the opposite side of the galaxy. But it
    were more correct to say that both are represented, to
    Far-Eastern imagination, by groups of stars. An old Japanese
    book puts the matter thus plainly: "Kengy&#363; (the Ox-Leader)
    is on the west side of the Heavenly River, and is represented
    by three stars in a row, and looks like a man leading an ox.
    Shokujo (the Weaving-Lady) is on the east side of the Heavenly
    River: three stars <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> so placed as to appear like the
       figure of a woman seated at her loom.... The former presides
       over all things relating to agriculture; the latter, over
       all that relates to women's work."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In an old book called Zatsuwa-Shin, it is said that these
    deities were of earthly origin. Once in this world they were
    man and wife, and lived in China; and the husband was called
    Ishi, and the wife Hakuy&#333;. They especially and most
    devoutly reverenced the Moon. Every clear evening, after
    sundown, they waited with eagerness to see her rise. And when
    she began to sink towards the horizon, they would climb to the
    top of a hill near their house, so that they might be able to
    gaze upon her face as long as possible. Then, when she at last
    disappeared from view, they would mourn together. At the age of
    ninety and nine, the wife died; and her spirit rode up to
    heaven on a magpie, and there became a star. The husband, who
    was then one hundred and three years old, sought consolation
    for his bereavement in looking at the Moon and when he welcomed
    her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> rising and mourned her setting,
       it seemed to him as if his wife were still beside him.</p>

    <p>One summer night, Hakuy&#333;&mdash;now immortally beautiful
    and young&mdash;descended from heaven upon her magpie, to visit
    her husband; and he was made very happy by that visit. But from
    that time he could think of nothing but the bliss of becoming a
    star, and joining Hakuy&#333; beyond the River of Heaven. At
    last he also ascended to the sky, riding upon a crow; and there
    he became a star-god. But he could not join Hakuy&#333; at
    once, as he had hoped;&mdash;for between his allotted place and
    hers flowed the River of Heaven; and it was not permitted for
    either star to cross the stream, because the Master of Heaven
    (<i>Ten-Tei</i>) daily bathed in its waters. Moreover, there
    was no bridge. But on one day every year&mdash;the seventh day
    of the seventh month&mdash;they were allowed to see each other.
    The Master of Heaven goes always on that day to the
    Zenh&#333;do, to hear the preaching of the law of Buddha; and
    then the magpies and the crows make, with their hovering bodies
    and outspread wings, a bridge over the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span> Celestial Stream; and
       Hakuy&#333; crosses that bridge to meet her husband.</p>

    <p>There can be little doubt that the Japanese festival called
    Tanabata was originally identical with the festival of the
    Chinese Weaving-Goddess, Tchi-Niu; the Japanese holiday seems
    to have been especially a woman's holiday, from the earliest
    times; and the characters with which the word Tanabata is
    written signify a weaving-girl. But as both of the star-deities
    were worshiped on the seventh of the seventh month, some
    Japanese scholars have not been satisfied with the common
    explanation of the name, and have stated that it was originally
    composed with the word <i>tané</i> (seed, or grain), and the
    word <i>hata</i> (loom). Those who accept this etymology make
    the appellation, Tanabata-Sama, plural instead of singular, and
    render it as "the deities of grain and of the loom,"&mdash;that
    is to say, those presiding over agriculture and weaving. In old
    Japanese pictures the star-gods are represented according to
    this conception of their respective attributes;&mdash;Hikoboshi
    being figured as a peasant lad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span> leading an ox to drink of the
       Heavenly River, on the farther side of which Orihimé
       (Tanabata) appears, weaving at her loom. The garb of both is
       Chinese; and the first Japanese pictures of these divinities
       were probably copied from some Chinese original.</p>

    <p>In the oldest collection of Japanese poetry
    extant,&mdash;the Many&#333;sh&#363;, dating from 760
    A.D.,&mdash;the male divinity is usually called Hikoboshi, and
    the female Tanabata-tsumé; but in later times both have been
    called Tanabata. In Izumo the male deity is popularly termed
    O-Tanabata Sama, and the female Mé-Tanabata Sama. Both are
    still known by many names. The male is called Kaiboshi as well
    as Hikoboshi and Kengy&#363;; while the female is called
    Asagao-himé ("Morning Glory Princess")<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>,
       Ito-ori-himé ("Thread-Weaving Princess"), Momoko-himé
       ("Peach-Child Princess"), Takimono-himé ("Incense
       Princess"), and Sasagani-himé ("Spider Princess"). Some of
       these names are difficult to explain,&mdash;especially
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> the last, which reminds us of
       the Greek legend of Arachne. Probably the Greek myth and the
       Chinese story have nothing whatever in common; but in old
       Chinese books there is recorded a curious fact which might
       well suggest a relationship. In the time of the Chinese
       Emperor Ming Hwang (whom the Japanese call Gens&#333;), it
       was customary for the ladies of the court, on the seventh
       day of the seventh month, to catch spiders and put them into
       an incense-box for purposes of divination. On the morning of
       the eighth day the box was opened; and if the spiders had
       spun thick webs during the night the omen was good. But if
       they had remained idle the omen was bad.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>There is a story that, many ages ago, a beautiful woman
    visited the dwelling of a farmer in the mountains of Izumo, and
    taught to the only daughter of the household an art of weaving
    never before known. One evening the beautiful stranger vanished
    away; and the people knew that they had seen the Weaving-Lady
    of Heaven. The daughter of the farmer
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span> became renowned for her skill
       in weaving. But she would never marry,&mdash;because she had
       been the companion of Tanabata-Sama.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Then there is a Chinese story&mdash;delightfully
    vague&mdash;about a man who once made a visit, unawares, to the
    Heavenly Land. He had observed that every year, during the
    eighth month, a raft of precious wood came floating to the
    shore on which he lived; and he wanted to know where that wood
    grew. So he loaded a boat with provisions for a two years'
    voyage, and sailed away in the direction from which the rafts
    used to drift. For months and months he sailed on, over an
    always placid sea; and at last he arrived at a pleasant shore,
    where wonderful trees were growing. He moored his boat, and
    proceeded alone into the unknown land, until he came to the
    bank of a river whose waters were bright as silver. On the
    opposite shore he saw a pavilion; and in the pavilion a
    beautiful woman sat weaving; she was white like moonshine, and
    made a radiance all about her. Presently he saw a handsome
    young peasant <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> approaching, leading an ox to
       the water; and he asked the young peasant to tell him the
       name of the place and the country. But the youth seemed to
       be displeased by the question, and answered in a severe
       tone: "If you want to know the name of this place, go back
       to where you came from, and ask
       Gen-Kum-Pei."<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       So the voyager, feeling afraid, hastened to his boat, and
       returned to China. There he sought out the sage Gen-Kum-Pei,
       to whom he related the adventure. Gen-Kum-Pei clapped his
       hands for wonder, and exclaimed, "So it was you!... On the
       seventh day of the seventh month I was gazing at the
       heavens, and I saw that the Herdsman and the Weaver were
       about to meet;&mdash;but between them was a new Star, which
       I took to be a Guest-Star. Fortunate man! you have been to
       the River of Heaven, and have looked upon the face of the
       Weaving-Lady!..."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;It is said that the meeting of the Herdsman and the
    Weaver can be observed by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> any one with good eyes; for
       whenever it occurs those stars burn with five different
       colors. That is why offerings of five colors are made to the
       Tanabata divinities, and why the poems composed in their
       praise are written upon paper of five different tints.</p>

    <p>But, as I have said before, the pair can meet only in fair
    weather. If there be the least rain upon the seventh night, the
    River of Heaven will rise, and the lovers must wait another
    whole year. Therefore the rain that happens to fall on Tanabata
    night is called <i>Namida no Amé</i>, "The Rain of Tears."</p>

    <p>When the sky is clear on the seventh night, the lovers are
    fortunate; and their stars can be seen to sparkle with delight.
    If the star Kengy&#363; then shines very brightly, there will
    be great rice crops in the autumn. If the star Shokujo looks
    brighter than usual, there will be a prosperous time for
    weavers, and for every kind of female industry.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In old Japan it was generally supposed that the meeting of
    the pair signified <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> good fortune to mortals. Even
       to-day, in many parts of the country, children sing a little
       song on the evening of the Tanabata festival,&mdash;<i>Tenki
       ni nari!</i> ("O weather, be clear!") In the province of Iga
       the young folks also sing a jesting song at the supposed
       hour of the lovers' meeting:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">Tanabata ya!</p>

    <p>But in the province of Izumo, which is a very rainy
    district, the contrary belief prevails; and it is thought that
    if the sky be clear on the seventh day of the seventh month,
    misfortune will follow. The local explanation of this belief is
    that if the stars can meet, there will be born from their union
    many evil deities who will afflict the country with drought and
    other calamities.</p>
    <hr />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

    <p>The festival of Tanabata was first celebrated in Japan on
    the seventh day of the seventh month of Tomby&#333;
    Sh&#333;h&#333; (A.D. 755). Perhaps the Chinese origin of the
    Tanabata divinities accounts for the fact that their public
    worship was at no time represented by many temples.</p>

    <p>I have been able to find record of only one temple to them,
    called Tanabata-jinja, which was situated at a village called
    Hoshiaimura, in the province of Owari, and surrounded by a
    grove called Tanabata-mori.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

    <p>Even before Temby&#333; Sh&#333;h&#333;, however, the legend
    of the Weaving-Maiden seems to have been well known in Japan;
    for it is recorded that on the seventh night of the seventh
    year of Y&#333;r&#333; (A.D. 723) the poet Yamagami no Okura
    composed the song:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It would seem that the Tanabata festival was first
    established in Japan eleven hundred and fifty years ago, as an
    Imperial Court festival only, in accordance with Chinese
    precedent. Subsequently the nobility and the military classes
    everywhere followed imperial example; and the custom of
    celebrating the Hoshi-mat-suri, or Star-Festival,&mdash;as it
    was popularly called,&mdash;spread gradually downwards, until
    at last the seventh day of the seventh month became, in the
    full sense of the term, a national holiday. But the fashion of
    its observance varied considerably at different eras and in
    different provinces.</p>

    <p>The ceremonies at the Imperial Court were of the most
    elaborate character: a full account of them is given in the
    <i>K&#333;ji Kongen</i>,&mdash;with explanatory illustrations.
    On the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month,
    mattings <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> were laid down on the east
       side of that portion of the Imperial Palace called the
       Seir-y&#333;den; and upon these mattings were placed four
       tables of offerings to the Star-deities. Besides the
       customary food-offerings, there were placed upon these
       tables rice-wine, incense, vases of red lacquer containing
       flowers, a harp and flute, and a needle with five eyes,
       threaded with threads of five different colors.
       Black-lacquered oil-lamps were placed beside the tables, to
       illuminate the feast. In another part of the grounds a tub
       of water was so placed as to reflect the light of the
       Tanabata-stars; and the ladies of the Imperial Household
       attempted to thread a needle by the reflection. She who
       succeeded was to be fortunate during the following year. The
       court-nobility (<i>Kugé</i>) were obliged to make certain
       offerings to the Imperial House on the day of the festival.
       The character of these offerings, and the manner of their
       presentation, were fixed by decree. They were conveyed to
       the palace upon a tray, by a veiled lady of rank, in
       ceremonial dress. Above her, as she walked, a great red
       umbrella was borne <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> by an attendant. On the tray
       were placed seven <i>tanzaku</i> (longilateral slips of fine
       tinted paper for the writing of poems); seven
       <i>kudzu</i>-leaves;<a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       seven inkstones; seven strings of <i>s&#333;men</i> (a kind
       of vermicelli); fourteen writing-brushes; and a bunch of
       yam-leaves gathered at night, and thickly sprinkled with
       dew. In the palace grounds the ceremony began at the Hour of
       the Tiger,&mdash;4 A.M. Then the inkstones were carefully
       washed,&mdash;prior to preparing the ink for the writing of
       poems in praise of the Star-deities,&mdash;and each one set
       upon a <i>kudzu</i>-leaf. One bunch of bedewed yam-leaves
       was then laid upon every inkstone; and with this dew,
       instead of water, the writing-ink was prepared. All the
       ceremonies appear to have been copied from those in vogue at
       the Chinese court in the time of the Emperor Ming-Hwang.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It was not until the time of the Tokugawa Sh&#333;gunate
    that the Tanabata festival became really a national holiday;
    and the popular custom of attaching <i>tansaku</i> of different
    colors <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> to freshly-cut bamboos, in
       celebration of the occasion, dates only from the era of
       Bunser (1818). Previously the <i>tanzaku</i> had been made
       of a very costly quality of paper; and the old aristocratic
       ceremonies had been not less expensive than elaborate. But
       in the time of the Tokugawa Sh&#333;gunate a very cheap
       paper of various colors was manufactured; and the holiday
       ceremonies were suffered to assume an inexpensive form, in
       which even the poorest classes could indulge.</p>

    <p>The popular customs relating to the festival differed
    according to locality. Those of Izumo&mdash;where all classes
    of society, <i>samurai</i> or common folk, celebrated the
    holiday in much the same way&mdash;used to be particularly
    interesting; and a brief account of them will suggest something
    of the happy aspects of life in feudal times. At the Hour of
    the Tiger, on the seventh night of the seventh month, everybody
    was up; and the work of washing the inkstones and
    writing-brushes was performed. Then, in the household garden,
    dew was collected upon yam-leaves. This dew was called
    <i>Amanogawa no suzuki</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> ("drops from the River of
       Heaven"); and it was used to make fresh ink for writing the
       poems which were to be suspended to bamboos planted in the
       garden. It was usual for friends to present each other with
       new inkstones at the time of the Tanabata festival; and if
       there were any new inkstones in the house, the fresh ink was
       prepared in these. Each member of the family then wrote
       poems. The adults composed verses, according to their
       ability, in praise of the Star-deities; and the children
       either wrote dictation or tried to improvise. Little folk
       too young to use the writing-brush without help had their
       small hands guided, by parent or elder sister or elder
       brother, so as to shape on a <i>tanzaku</i> the character of
       some single word or phrase relating to the
       festival,&mdash;such as "Amanogawa," or "Tanabata," or
       "Kasasagi no Hashi" (the Bridge of Magpies). In the garden
       were planted two freshly-cut bamboos, with branches and
       leaves entire,&mdash;a male bamboo (<i>otoko-daké</i>) and a
       female bamboo (<i>onna-daké</i>). They were set up about six
       feet apart, and to a cord extended between them were
       suspended <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> paper-cuttings of five
       colors, and skeins of dyed thread of five colors. The
       paper-cuttings represented upper-robes,&mdash;<i>kimono</i>.
       To the leaves and branches of the bamboos were tied the
       <i>tanzaku</i> on which poems had been written by the
       members of the family. And upon a table, set between the
       bamboos, or immediately before them, were placed vessels
       containing various offerings to the
       Star-deities,&mdash;fruits, <i>s&#333;men</i>, rice-wine,
       and vegetables of different kinds, such as cucumbers and
       watermelons.</p>

    <p>But the most curious Izumo custom relating to the festival
    was the <i>Nému-nagashi</i>, or "Sleep-wash-away" ceremony.
    Before day-break the young folks used to go to some stream,
    carrying with them bunches composed of <i>némuri</i>-leaves and
    bean-leaves mixed together. On reaching the stream, they would
    fling their bunches of leaves into the current, and sing a
    little song:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Nému wa, nagaré yo!</p>

            <p>Mamé no ha wa, tomaré!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>These verses might be rendered in two ways;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span> because the word <i>nému</i>
       can be taken in the meaning either of <i>némuri</i> (sleep),
       or of <i>nemuri-gi</i> or <i>némunoki</i>, the "sleep-plant"
       (mimosa),&mdash;while the syllables <i>mamé</i>, as written
       in <i>kana</i>, can signify either "bean," or "activity," or
       "strength," "vigor," "health," etc. But the ceremony was
       symbolical, and the intended meaning of the song
       was:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Drowsiness, drift away!</p>

            <p>Leaves of vigor, remain!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>After this, all the young folk would jump into the water, to
    bathe or swim, in token of their resolve to shed all laziness
    for the coming year, and to maintain a vigorous spirit of
    endeavor.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Yet it was probably in Yédo (now T&#333;ky&#333;) that the
    Tanabata festival assumed its most picturesque aspects. During
    the two days that the celebration lasted,&mdash;the sixth and
    seventh of the seventh month,&mdash;the city used to present
    the appearance of one vast bamboo grove; fresh bamboos, with
    poems attached to them, being erected upon the roofs of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> houses. Peasants were in
       those days able to do a great business in bamboos, which
       were brought into town by hundreds of wagonloads for holiday
       use. Another feature of the Yédo festival was the children's
       procession, in which bamboos, with poems attached to them,
       were carried about the city. To each such bamboo there was
       also fastened a red plaque on which were painted, in Chinese
       characters, the names of the Tanabata stars.</p>

    <p>But almost everywhere, under the Tokugawa régime, the
    Tanabata festival used to be a merry holiday for the young
    people of all classes,&mdash;a holiday beginning with lantern
    displays before sunrise, and lasting well into the following
    night. Boys and girls on that day were dressed in their best,
    and paid visits of ceremony to friends and neighbors.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;The moon of the seventh month used to be called
    <i>Tanabata-tsuki</i>, or "The Moon of Tanabata." And it was
    also called <i>Fumi-tsuki</i>, or "The Literary Moon," because
    during the seventh month poems were everywhere
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> composed in praise of the
       Celestial Lovers.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>I think that my readers ought to be interested in the
    following selection of ancient Japanese poems, treating of the
    Tanabata legend. All are from the <i>Many&#333;sh&#363;</i>.
    The <i>Many&#333;sh&#363;</i>, or "Gathering of a Myriad
    Leaves," is a vast collection of poems composed before the
    middle of the eighth century. It was compiled by Imperial
    order, and completed early in the ninth century. The number of
    the poems which it contains is upwards of four thousand; some
    being "long poems" (<i>naga-uta</i>), but the great majority
    <i>tanka</i>, or compositions limited to thirty-one syllables;
    and the authors were courtiers or high officials. The first
    eleven <i>tanka</i> hereafter translated were composed by
    Yamagami no Okura, Governor of the province of Chikuzen more
    than eleven hundred years ago. His fame as a poet is well
    deserved; for not a little of his work will bear comparison
    with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> some of the finer epigrams of
       the Greek Anthology. The following verses, upon the death of
       his little son Furubi, will serve as an example:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">Wakakeréba</p>

            <p>Nichi-yuki shiraji:</p>

            <p class="i2">Mahi wa sému,</p>

            <p>Shitabé no tsukahi</p>

            <p>Ohité-tohorasé.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>&mdash;[<i>As he is so young, he cannot know the way....
        To the messenger of the Underworld I will give a bribe, and
        entreat him, saying: "Do thou kindly take the little one
        upon thy back along the road."</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Eight hundred years earlier, the Greek poet Diodorus Zonas
    of Sardis had written:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Do thou, who rowest the boat of the dead in the
        water of this reedy lake, for Hades, stretch out thy hand,
        dark Charon, to the son of Kinyras, as he mounts the ladder
        by the gang-way, and receive him. For his sandals will
        cause the lad to slip, and he fears to set his feet naked
        on the sand of the shore.</i>"</p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

    <p>But the charming epigram of Diodorus was inspired only by a
    myth,&mdash;for the "son of Kinyras" was no other than
    Adonis,&mdash;whereas the verses of Okura express for us the
    yearning of a father's heart.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;Though the legend of Tanabata was indeed borrowed
    from China, the reader will find nothing Chinese in the
    following compositions. They represent the old classic poetry
    at its purest, free from alien influence; and they offer us
    many suggestions as to the condition of Japanese life and
    thought twelve hundred years ago. Remembering that they were
    written before any modern European literature had yet taken
    form, one is startled to find how little the Japanese written
    language has changed in the course of so many centuries.
    Allowing for a few obsolete words, and sundry slight changes of
    pronunciation, the ordinary Japanese reader to-day can enjoy
    these early productions of his native muse with about as little
    difficulty as the English reader finds in studying the poets of
    the Elizabethan era. Moreover, the refinement and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span> simple charm of the
       <i>Many&#333;sh&#363;</i> compositions have never been
       surpassed, and seldom equaled, by later Japanese poets.</p>

    <p>As for the forty-odd <i>tanka</i> which I have translated,
    their chief attraction lies, I think, in what they reveal to us
    of the human nature of their authors. Tanabata-tsumé still
    represents for us the Japanese wife, worshipfully
    loving;&mdash;Hikoboshi appears to us with none of the
    luminosity of the god, but as the young Japanese husband of the
    sixth or seventh century, before Chinese ethical convention had
    begun to exercise its restraint upon life and literature. Also
    these poems interest us by their expression of the early
    feeling for natural beauty. In them we find the scenery and the
    seasons of Japan transported to the Blue Plain of High
    Heaven;&mdash;the Celestial Stream with its rapids and
    shallows, its sudden risings and clamourings within its stony
    bed, and its water-grasses bending in the autumn wind, might
    well be the Kamogawa;&mdash;and the mists that haunt its shores
    are the very mists of Arashiyama. The boat of Hikoboshi,
    impelled by a single oar working upon a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> wooden peg, is not yet
       obsolete; and at many a country ferry you may still see the
       <i>hiki-funé</i> in which Tanabata-tsumé prayed her husband
       to cross in a night of storm,&mdash;a flat broad barge
       pulled over the river by cables. And maids and wives still
       sit at their doors in country villages, on pleasant autumn
       days, to weave as Tanabata-tsumé wove for the sake of her
       lord and lover.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;It will be observed that, in most of these verses, it
    is not the wife who dutifully crosses the Celestial River to
    meet her husband, but the husband who rows over the stream to
    meet the wife; and there is no reference to the Bridge of
    Birds.... As for my renderings, those readers who know by
    experience the difficulty of translating Japanese verse will be
    the most indulgent, I fancy. The Romaji system of spelling has
    been followed (except in one or two cases where I thought it
    better to indicate the ancient syllabication after the method
    adopted by Aston); and words or phrases necessarily supplied
    have been inclosed in
    parentheses.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"

       that grazes on the farther shore;&mdash;and I know that the
       falling dew is the spray from the Herdsman's oar. And the
       heaven seems very near and warm and human; and the silence
       about me is filled with the dream of a love unchanging,
       immortal,&mdash;forever yearning and forever young, and

    <h2>GOBLIN POETRY</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>

    <p>Recently, while groping about an old book shop, I found a
    collection of Goblin Poetry in three volumes, containing many
    pictures of goblins. The title of the collection is
    <i>Ky&#333;ka Hyaku-Monogatari</i>, or "The Mad Poetry of the
    <i>Hyaku-Monogatari</i>." The <i>Hyaku-Monogatari</i>, or
    "Hundred Tales," is a famous book of ghost stories. On the
    subject of each of the stories, poems were composed at
    different times by various persons,&mdash;poems of the sort
    called <i>Ky&#333;ka</i>, or Mad Poetry,&mdash;and these were
    collected and edited to form the three volumes of which I
    became the fortunate possessor. The collecting was done by a
    certain Takumi Jingor&#333;, who wrote under the literary
    pseudonym <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> "Temmér Ré&#333;jin" (Ancient
       of the Temmér Era). Takumi died in the first year of
       Bunky&#363; (1861), at the good age of eighty; and his
       collection seems to have been published in the sixth year of
       Kaéï (1853). The pictures were made by an artist called
       Masazumi, who worked under the pseudonym "Ry&#333;sai
       Kanjin."</p>

    <p>From a prefatory note it appears that Takumi Jingor&#333;
    published his collection with the hope of reviving interest in
    a once popular kind of poetry which had fallen into neglect
    before the middle of the century. The word <i>ky&#333;ka</i> is
    written with a Chinese character signifying "insane" or
    "crazy;" and it means a particular and extraordinary variety of
    comic poetry. The form is that of the classic <i>tanka</i> of
    thirty-one syllables (arranged 57577);&mdash;but the subjects
    are always the extreme reverse of classical; and the artistic
    effects depend upon methods of verbal jugglery which cannot be
    explained without the help of numerous examples. The collection
    published by Takumi includes a good deal of matter in which a
    Western reader can discover no merit; but the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span> best of it has a distinctly
       grotesque quality that reminds one of Hood's weird
       cleverness in playing with grim subjects. This quality, and
       the peculiar Japanese method of mingling the playful with
       the terrific, can be suggested and explained only by
       reproducing in Romaji the texts of various
       <i>ky&#333;ka</i>, with translations and notes.</p>

    <p>The selection which I have made should prove interesting,
    not merely because it will introduce the reader to a class of
    Japanese poetry about which little or nothing has yet been
    written in English, but much more because it will afford some
    glimpses of a supernatural world which still remains for the
    most part unexplored. Without knowledge of Far Eastern
    superstitions and folk-tales, no real understanding of Japanese
    fiction or drama or poetry will ever become possible.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>There are many hundreds of poems in the three volumes of the
    <i>Ky&#333;ka Hyaku-Monogatari</i>; but the number of the
    ghosts and goblins falls short of the one hundred suggested by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span> the title. There are just
       ninety-five. I could not expect to interest my readers in
       the whole of this goblinry, and my selection includes less
       than one seventh of the subjects. The Faceless Babe, The
       Long-Tongued Maiden, The Three-Eyed Monk, The Pillow-Mover,
       The Thousand Heads, The Acolyte-with-the-Lantern, The
       Stone-that-Cries-in-the-Night, The Goblin-Heron, The
       Goblin-Wind, The Dragon-Lights, and The Mountain-Nurse, did
       not much impress me. I omitted <i>ky&#333;ka</i> dealing
       with fancies too gruesome for Western nerves,&mdash;such as
       that of the <i>Obumédori</i>,&mdash;also those treating of
       merely local tradition. The subjects chosen represent
       national rather than provincial folklore,&mdash;old beliefs
       (mostly of Chinese origin) once prevalent throughout the
       country, and often referred to in its popular
       literature.</p>

    <h3>I. KITSUNÉ-BI</h3>

    <p>The Will-o'-the-wisp is called <i>kitsuné-bi</i>
    ("fox-fire"), because the goblin-fox was formerly supposed to
    create it. In old Japanese
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> pictures it is represented as
       a tongue of pale red flame, hovering in darkness, and
       shedding no radiance upon the surfaces over which it
       glides.</p>

    <p>To understand some of the following <i>ky&#333;ka</i> on the
    subject, the reader should know that certain superstitions
    about the magical power of the fox have given rise to several
    queer folk-sayings,&mdash;one of which relates to marrying a
    stranger. Formerly a good citizen was expected to marry within
    his own community, not outside of it; and the man who dared to
    ignore traditional custom in this regard would have found it
    difficult to appease the communal indignation. Even to-day the
    villager who, after a long absence from his birthplace, returns
    with a strange bride, is likely to hear unpleasant things
    said,&mdash;such as: "<i>Wakaranai-mono we hippaté-kita!...
    Doko no uma no honé da ka?</i>" ("Goodness knows what kind of a
    thing he has dragged here after him! Where did he pick up that
    old horse-bone?") The expression <i>uma no honé</i>, "old
    horse-bone," requires
    explanation.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>

    <p>A goblin-fox has the power to assume many shapes; but, for
    the purpose of deceiving <i>men</i>, he usually takes the form
    of a pretty woman. When he wants to create a charming phantom
    of this kind, he picks up an old horse-bone or cow-bone, and
    holds it in his mouth. Presently the bone becomes luminous; and
    the figure of a woman defines about it,&mdash;the figure of a
    courtesan or singing-girl.... So the village query about the
    man who marries a strange wife, "What old horse-bone has he
    picked up?" signifies really, "What wanton has bewitched him?"
    It further implies the suspicion that the stranger may be of
    outcast blood: a certain class of women of pleasure having been
    chiefly recruited, from ancient time, among the daughters of
    Éta and other pariah-people.</p>

    <h3>II. RIKOMBY&#332;</h3>

    <p>The term <i>Rikomby&#333;</i> is composed with the word
    <i>rikon</i>, signifying a "shade," "ghost," or "spectre," and
    the word <i>by&#333;</i>, signifying "sickness," "disease." An
    almost literal rendering would be "ghost-sickness." In
    Japanese-English dictionaries you will find the meaning of
    <i>Rikomby&#333;</i> given as "hypochondria;" and doctors
    really use the term in this modern sense. But the ancient
    meaning was <i>a disorder of the mind which produced a
    Double</i>; and there is a whole strange literature about this
    weird disease. It used to be supposed, both in China and Japan,
    that under the influence of intense grief or longing, caused by
    love, the spirit of the suffering person would create a Double.
    Thus the victim of <i>Rikomby&#333;</i> would appear to have
    two bodies, exactly alike; and one of these bodies would go to
    join the absent beloved, while the other remained at home. (In
    my "Exotics and Retrospectives," under the title "A Question in
    the Zen Texts," the reader will find a typical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span> Chinese story on the
       subject,&mdash;the story of the girl Ts'ing.) Some form of
       the primitive belief in doubles and wraiths probably exists
       in every part of the world; but this Far Eastern variety is
       of peculiar interest because the double is supposed to be
       caused by love, and the subjects of the affliction to belong
       to the gentler sex.... The term <i>Rikomby&#333;</i> seems
       to be applied to the apparition as well as to the mental
       disorder supposed to produce the apparition: it signifies
       "doppelgänger" as well as "ghost-disease."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;With these necessary explanations, the quality of the
    following <i>ky&#333;ka</i> can be understood. A picture which
    appears in the <i>Ky&#333;ka Hyaku-Monogatari</i> shows a
    maid-servant anxious to offer a cup of tea to her
    mistress,&mdash;a victim of the "ghost-sickness." The servant
    cannot distinguish between the original and the apparitional
    shapes before her; and the difficulties of the situation are
    suggested in the first of the <i>ky&#333;ka</i> which I have
    translated:&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"

    <h3>III. &#332;-GAMA</h3>

    <p>In the old Chinese and Japanese literature the toad is
    credited with supernatural
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> capacities,&mdash;such as the
       power to call down clouds, the power to make rain, the power
       to exhale from its mouth a magical mist which creates the
       most beautiful illusions. Some toads are good
       spirits,&mdash;friends of holy men; and in Japanese art a
       famous Rishi called "Gama-Sennin" (Toad Rishi) is usually
       represented with a white toad resting upon his shoulder, or
       squatting beside him. Some toads are evil goblins, and
       create phantasms for the purpose of luring men to
       destruction. A typical story about a creature of this class
       will be found in my "Kott&#333;," entitled "The Story of
       Chug&#333;r&#333;."</p>

    <h3>IV. SHINKIR&#332;</h3>

    <p>The term <i>Shinkir&#333;</i> is used in the meaning of
    "mirage," and also as another name for H&#333;rai, the Elf-land
    of Far Eastern fable. Various beings in Japanese myth are
    credited with power to delude mortals by creating a mirage of
    H&#333;rai. In old pictures one may see a toad represented in
    the act of exhaling from its mouth a vapor that shapes the
    apparition of H&#333;rai.</p>

    <p>But the creature especially wont to produce this illusion is
    the <i>Hamaguri</i>,&mdash;a Japanese mollusk much resembling a
    clam. Opening its shell, it sends into the air a purplish misty
    breath; and that mist takes form and defines, in tints of
    mother-of-pearl, the luminous vision of H&#333;rai and the
    palace of the Dragon-King.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>V. ROKURO-KUBI</h3>

    <p>The etymological meaning of <i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> can scarcely
    be indicated by any English rendering. The term <i>rokuro</i>
    is indifferently used to designate many revolving
    objects&mdash;objects <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span> as dissimilar as a pulley, a
       capstan, a windlass, a turning lathe, and a potter's wheel.
       Such renderings of Rokuro-Kubi as "Whirling-Neck" and
       "Rotating-Neck" are unsatisfactory;&mdash;for the idea which
       the term suggests to Japanese fancy is that of a neck which
       revolves, <i>and lengthens or retracts according to the
       direction of the revolution</i>.... As for the ghostly
       meaning of the expression, a Rokuro-Kubi is either (1) a
       person whose neck lengthens prodigiously during sleep, so
       that the head can wander about in all directions, seeking
       what it may devour, or (2) a person able to detach his or
       her head completely from the body, and to rejoin it to the
       neck afterwards. (About this last mentioned variety of
       <i>Rokuro-Kubi</i> there is a curious story in my "Kwaidan,"
       translated from the Japanese.) In Chinese mythology the
       being whose neck is so constructed as to allow of the head
       being completely detached belongs to a special class; but in
       Japanese folk-tale this distinction is not always
       maintained. One of the bad habits attributed to the
       Rokuro-Kubi is that of drinking the oil in night-lamps. In
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> Japanese pictures the
       Rokuro-Kubi is usually depicted as a woman; and old books
       tell us that a woman might become a Rokuro-Kubi without
       knowing it,&mdash;much as a somnambulist walks about while
       asleep, without being aware of the fact.... The following
       verses about the Rokuro-Kubi have been selected from a group
       of twenty in the <i>Ky&#333;ka

    <h3>VI. YUKI-ONNA</h3>

    <p>The Snow-Woman, or Snow-Spectre, assumes various forms; but
    in most of the old folk-tales she appears as a beautiful
    phantom, whose embrace is death. (A very curious story about
    her can be found in my "Kwaidan.")</p>

    <h3>VII. FUNA-Y&#362;RÉÏ</h3>

    <p>The spirits of the drowned are said to follow after ships,
    calling for a bucket or a water-dipper (<i>hishaku</i>). To
    refuse the bucket or the dipper is dangerous; but the bottom of
    the utensil should be knocked out before the request is
    complied with, and the spectres must not be allowed to see this
    operation performed. If an undamaged bucket or dipper be thrown
    to the ghosts, it will be used to fill and to sink the ship.
    These phantoms are commonly called <i>Funa-Y&#363;réï</i>
    ("Ship-Ghosts").</p>

    <p>The spirits of those warriors of the Héïké clan who perished
    in the great sea-fight at Dan-no-ura, in the year 1185, are
    famous among Funa-Y&#363;réï. Taïra no Tomomori, one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> of the chiefs of the clan, is
       celebrated in this weird rôle: old pictures represent him,
       followed by the ghosts of his warriors, running over the
       waves to attack passing ships. Once he menaced a vessel in
       which Benkéï, the celebrated retainer of Yoshitsuné, was
       voyaging; and Benkéï was able to save the ship only by means
       of his Buddhist rosary, which frightened the spectres
       away....</p>

    <p>Tomomori is frequently pictured as walking upon the sea,
    carrying a ship's anchor on his back. He and his fellow-ghosts
    are said to have been in the habit of uprooting and making off
    with the anchors of vessels imprudently moored in their
    particular domain,&mdash;the neighborhood of Shimonoséki.</p>

    <h3>IX. YANARI</h3>

    <p>Modern dictionaries ignore the uncanny significations of the
    word <i>Yanari</i>,&mdash;only telling us that it means the
    sound of the shaking of a house during an earthquake. But the
    word used to mean the noise of the shaking of a house moved by
    a goblin; and the invisible shaker was also called
    <i>Yanari</i>. When, without apparent cause, some house would
    shudder and creak and groan in the night, folk used to suppose
    that it was being shaken from without by supernatural
    malevolence.</p>

    <h3>X. SAKASA-BASHIRA</h3>

    <p>The term <i>Sakasa-bashira</i> (in these <i>ky&#333;ka</i>
    often shortened into <i>saka-bashira</i>) literally means
    "upside-down post." A wooden post or pillar, especially a
    house-post, should be set up according to the original position
    of the tree from which it was hewn,&mdash;that is to say, with
    the part nearest to the roots downward. To erect a house-post
    in the contrary way is thought to be unlucky;&mdash;formerly
    such a blunder was believed to involve unpleasant consequences
    of a ghostly kind, because an "upside-down" pillar would do
    malignant things. It would moan and groan in the night, and
    move all its cracks <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> like mouths, and open all its
       knots like eyes. Moreover, the spirit of it (for every
       house-post has a spirit) would detach its long body from the
       timber, and wander about the rooms, head-downwards, making
       faces at people. Nor was this all. A <i>Sakasa-bashira</i>
       knew how to make all the affairs of a household go
       wrong,&mdash;how to foment domestic quarrels,&mdash;how to
       contrive misfortune for each of the family and the
       servants,&mdash;how to render existence almost insupportable
       until such time as the carpenter's blunder should be
       discovered and remedied.</p>

    <h3>XI. BAKÉ-JIZÖ</h3>

    <p>The figure of the Bodhi-sattva Jizö, the savior of
    children's ghosts, is one of the most beautiful and humane in
    Japanese Buddhism. Statues of this divinity may be seen in
    almost every village and by every roadside. But some statues of
    Jizö are said to do uncanny
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> things&mdash;such as to walk
       about at night in various disguises. A statue of this kind
       is called a <i>Baké-Jiz&#333;</i><a id="footnotetag56"
       name="footnotetag56"></a><a href="#footnote56"><sup>56</sup></a>,&mdash;meaning
       a Jiz&#333;; that undergoes transformation. A conventional
       picture shows a little boy about to place the customary
       child's-offering of rice-cakes before the stone image of
       Jiz&#333;,&mdash;not suspecting that the statue moves, and
       is slowly bending down towards him.</p>

    <p>Place a large cuttlefish on a table, body upwards and

    <i>Umi-B&#333;zu</i>, or Priest of the Sea. For the great bald
    body in this position, with the staring eyes below, bears a
    distorted resemblance to the shaven head of a priest; while the
    crawling tentacles underneath (which are in some species united
    by a dark web) suggests the wavering motion of the priest's
    upper robe.... The Umi-B&#333;zu figures a good deal in the
    literature of Japanese goblinry, and in the old-fashioned
    picture-books. He rises from the deep in foul weather to seize
    his prey.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"

       name="footnotetag59"></a><a href="#footnote59"><sup>59</sup></a></h3>

    <p>Homes are protected from evil spirits by holy texts and
    charms. In any Japanese <span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span> village, or any city
       by-street, you can see these texts when the sliding-doors
       are closed at night: they are not visible by day, when the
       sliding-doors have been pushed back into the
       <i>tobukuro</i>. Such texts are called <i>o-fuda</i> (august
       scripts): they are written in Chinese characters upon strips
       of white paper, which are attached to the door with
       rice-paste; and there are many kinds of them. Some are texts
       selected from sutras&mdash;such as the Sûtra of Transcendent
       Wisdom (Pragña-Pâramitâ-Hridaya-Sûtra), or the Sûtra of the
       Lotos of the Good Law (Saddharma-Pundarikâ-Sûtra). Some are
       texts from the dhâranîs,&mdash;which are magical. Some are
       invocations only, indicating the Buddhist sect of the
       household.... Besides these you may see various smaller
       texts, or little prints, pasted above or beside windows or
       apertures,&mdash;some being names of Shinto gods; others,
       symbolical pictures only, or pictures of Buddhas and
       Bodhi-sattvas. All are holy charms,&mdash;<i>o-fuda</i>:
       they protect the houses; and no goblin or ghost can enter by
       night into a dwelling so protected, unless the <i>o-fuda</i>
       be removed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"

    <p>Vengeful ghosts cannot themselves remove an <i>o-fuda</i>;

    <h3>XIV. FURU-TSUBAKI</h3>

    <p>The old Japanese, like the old Greeks, had their
    flower-spirits and their hamadryads, concerning whom some
    charming stories are told. They also believed in trees
    inhabited by malevolent beings,&mdash;goblin trees. Among other
    weird trees, the beautiful <i>tsubaki</i> (<i>Camellia
    Japonica</i>) was said to be an unlucky tree;&mdash;this was
    said, at least, of the red-flowering variety, the
    white-flowering kind having a better reputation and being
    prized as a rarity. The large fleshy crimson flowers have this
    curious habit: they detach themselves bodily from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span> stem, when they begin to
       fade; and they fall with an audible thud. To old Japanese
       fancy the falling of these heavy red flowers was like the
       falling of human heads under the sword; and the dull sound
       of their dropping was said to be like the thud made by a
       severed head striking the ground. Nevertheless the tsubaki
       seems to have been a favorite in Japanese gardens because of
       the beauty of its glossy foliage; and its flowers were used
       for the decoration of alcoves. But in samurai homes it was a
       rule never to place tsubaki-flowers in an alcove <i>during
       war-time</i>.</p>

    <p>The reader will notice that in the following
    <i>ky&#333;ka</i>&mdash;which, as grotesques, seem to me the
    best in the collection&mdash;the goblin-tsubaki is called
    <i>furu-tsubaki</i>, "old tsubaki." The young tree was not
    supposed to have goblin-propensities,&mdash;these being
    developed only after many years. Other uncanny trees&mdash;such
    as the willow and the <i>énoki</i>&mdash;were likewise said to
    become dangerous only as they became old; and a similar belief
    prevailed on the subject of uncanny animals, such as the
    cat&mdash;innocent in kittenhood, but devilish in
    age.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97"

    <p>&mdash;Nearly all the stories and folk-beliefs about which
    these <i>ky&#333;ka</i> were written seem to have come from
    China; and most of the Japanese tales of tree-spirits appear to
    have had a Chinese origin. As the flower-spirits and hamadryads
    of the Far East are as yet little known to Western readers, the
    following Chinese story may be found interesting.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>There was a Chinese scholar&mdash;called, in Japanese books,
    T&#333; no Busanshi&mdash;who was famous for his love of
    flowers. He was particularly fond of peonies, and cultivated
    them with great skill and patience.<a id="footnotetag64"
       name="footnotetag64"></a><a href="#footnote64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>

    <p>One day a very comely girl came to the house of Busanshi,
    and begged to be taken into his service. She said that
    circumstances obliged her to seek humble employment, but that
    she had received a literary education, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> therefore wished to enter,
       if possible, into the service of a scholar. Busanshi was
       charmed by her beauty, and took her into his household
       without further questioning. She proved to be much more than
       a good domestic: indeed, the nature of her accomplishments
       made Busanshi suspect that she had been brought up in the
       court of some prince, or in the palace of some great lord.
       She displayed a perfect knowledge of the etiquette and the
       polite arts which are taught only to ladies of the highest
       rank; and she possessed astonishing skill in calligraphy, in
       painting, and in every kind of poetical composition.
       Busanshi presently fell in love with her, and thought only
       of how to please her. When scholar-friends or other visitors
       of importance came to the house, he would send for the new
       maid that she might entertain and wait upon his guests; and
       all who saw her were amazed by her grace and charm.</p>

    <p>One day Busanshi received a visit from the great
    Teki-Shin-Ketsu, a famous teacher of moral doctrine; and the
    maid did not respond to her master's call. Busanshi went
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span> himself to seek her, being
       desirous that Teki-Shin-Ketsu should see her and admire her;
       but she was nowhere to be found. After having searched the
       whole house in vain, Busanshi was returning to the
       guest-room when he suddenly caught sight of the maid,
       gliding soundlessly before him along a corridor. He called
       to her, and hurried after her. Then she turned half-round,
       and flattened herself against the wall like a spider; and as
       he reached her she sank backwards into the wall, so that
       there remained of her nothing visible but a colored
       shadow,&mdash;level like a picture painted on the plaster.
       But the shadow moved its lips and eyes, and spoke to him in
       a whisper, saying:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Pardon me that I did not obey your august call!... I am not
    a mankind-person;&mdash;I am only the Soul of a Peony. Because
    you loved peonies so much, I was able to take human shape, and
    to serve you. But now this Teki-Shin-Ketsu has come,&mdash;and
    he is a person of dreadful propriety,&mdash;and I dare not keep
    this form any longer.... I must return to the place from which
    I came."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

    <p>Then she sank back into the wall, and vanished altogether:
    there was nothing where she had been except the naked plaster.
    And Busanshi never saw her again.</p>

    QUESTIONS"</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"

    <p>A memory of long ago.... I am walking upon a granite
    pavement that rings like iron, between buildings of granite
    bathed in the light of a cloudless noon. Shadows are short and
    sharp: there is no stir in the hot bright air; and the sound of
    my footsteps, strangely loud, is the only sound in the
    street.... Suddenly an odd feeling comes to me, with a sort of
    tingling shock,&mdash;a feeling, or suspicion, of universal
    illusion. The pavement, the bulks of hewn stone, the iron
    rails, and all things visible, are dreams! Light, color, form,
    weight, solidity&mdash;all sensed existences&mdash;are but
    phantoms of being, manifestations only of one infinite
    ghostliness for which the language of man has not any
    word....</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>

    <p>This experience had been produced by study of the first
    volume of the Synthetic Philosophy, which an American friend
    had taught me how to read. I did not find it easy reading;
    partly because I am a slow thinker, but chiefly because my mind
    had never been trained to sustained effort in such directions.
    To learn the "First Principles" occupied me many months: no
    other volume of the series gave me equal trouble. I would read
    one section at a time,&mdash;rarely two,&mdash;never venturing
    upon a fresh section until I thought that I had made sure of
    the preceding. Very cautious and slow my progress was, like
    that of a man mounting, for the first time, a long series of
    ladders in darkness. Reaching the light at last, I caught a
    sudden new vision of things,&mdash;a momentary perception of
    the illusion of surfaces,&mdash;and from that time the world
    never again appeared to me quite the same as it had appeared
    before.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;This memory of more than twenty years ago, and the
    extraordinary thrill of the moment, were recently revived for
    me by the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> reading of the essay
       "Ultimate Questions," in the last and not least precious
       volume bequeathed us by the world's greatest thinker. The
       essay contains his final utterance about the riddle of life
       and death, as that riddle presented itself to his vast mind
       in the dusk of a lifetime of intellectual toil. Certainly
       the substance of what he had to tell us might have been
       inferred from the Synthetic Philosophy; but the particular
       interest of this last essay is made by the writer's
       expression of personal sentiment regarding the problem that
       troubles all deep thinkers. Perhaps few of us could have
       remained satisfied with his purely scientific position. Even
       while fully accepting his declaration of the identity of the
       power that "wells up in us under the form of consciousness"
       with that Power Unknowable which shapes all things, most
       disciples of the master must have longed for some chance to
       ask him directly, "But how do <i>you</i> feel in regard to
       the prospect of personal dissolution?" And this merely
       emotional question he has answered as frankly and as fully
       as any of us could have desired,&mdash;perhaps
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> even more frankly. "Old
       people," he remarks apologetically, "must have many
       reflections in common. Doubtless one which I have now in
       mind is very familiar. For years past, when watching the
       unfolding buds in the spring, there has arisen the thought,
       'Shall I ever again see the buds unfold? Shall I ever again
       be awakened at dawn by the song of the thrush?' Now that the
       end is not likely to be long postponed, there results an
       increasing tendency to meditate upon ultimate questions."...
       Then he tells us that these ultimate questions&mdash;"of the
       How and the Why, of the Whence and the Whither"&mdash;occupy
       much more space in the minds of those who cannot accept the
       creed of Christendom, than the current conception fills in
       the minds of the majority of men. The enormity of the
       problem of existence becomes manifest only to those who have
       permitted themselves to think freely and widely and deeply,
       with all such aids to thought as exact science can furnish;
       and the larger the knowledge of the thinker, the more
       pressing and tremendous the problem appears, and
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span> the more hopelessly
       unanswerable. To Herbert Spencer himself it must have
       assumed a vastness beyond the apprehension of the average
       mind; and it weighed upon him more and more inexorably the
       nearer he approached to death. He could not avoid the
       conviction&mdash;plainly suggested in his magnificent
       Psychology and in other volumes of his great work&mdash;that
       there exists no rational evidence for any belief in the
       continuance of conscious personality after death:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"After studying primitive beliefs, and finding that
        there is no origin for the idea of an after-life, save the
        conclusion which the savage draws, from the notion
        suggested by dreams, of a wandering double which comes back
        on awaking, and which goes away for an indefinite time at
        death;&mdash;and after contemplating the inscrutable
        relation between brain and consciousness, and finding that
        we can get no evidence of the existence of the last without
        the activity of the first,&mdash;we seem obliged to
        relinquish the thought that consciousness continues after
        physical organization has become inactive."</p>
    </blockquote><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>

    <p>In this measured utterance there is no word of hope; but
    there is at least a carefully stated doubt, which those who
    will may try to develop into the germ of a hope. The guarded
    phrase, "we <i>seem</i> obliged to relinquish," certainly
    suggests that, although in the present state of human knowledge
    we have no reason to believe in the perpetuity of
    consciousness, some larger future knowledge might help us to a
    less forlorn prospect. From the prospect as it now appears even
    this mightiest of thinkers recoiled:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>... "But it seems a strange and repugnant conclusion
        that with the cessation of consciousness at death there
        ceases to be any knowledge of having existed. With his last
        breath it becomes to each the same thing as though he had
        never lived.</p>

        <p>"And then the consciousness itself&mdash;what is it
        during the time that it continues? And what becomes of it
        when it ends? We can only infer that it is a specialized
        and individualized form of that Infinite and Eternal Energy
        which transcends both our knowledge and our imagination;
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
           id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span> and that at death its
           elements lapse into that Infinite and Eternal Energy
           whence they were derived."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <p>&mdash;<i>With his last breath it becomes to each the same
    thing as though he had never lived?</i> To the individual,
    perhaps&mdash;surely not to the humanity made wiser and better
    by his labors.... But the world must pass away: will it
    thereafter be the same for the universe as if humanity had
    never existed? That might depend upon the possibilities of
    future inter-planetary communication.... But the whole universe
    of suns and planets must also perish: thereafter will it be the
    same as if no intelligent life had ever toiled and suffered
    upon those countless worlds? We have at least the certainty
    that the energies of life cannot be destroyed, and the strong
    probability that they will help to form another life and
    thought in universes yet to be evolved.... Nevertheless,
    allowing for all imagined possibilities,&mdash;granting even
    the likelihood of some inapprehensible relation between all
    past and all future <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
       conditioned-being,&mdash;the tremendous question remains:
       What signifies the whole of apparitional existence to the
       Unconditioned? As flickers of sheet-lightning leave no
       record in the night, so in that Darkness a million billion
       trillion universes might come and go, and leave no trace of
       their having been.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>To every aspect of the problem Herbert Spencer must have
    given thought; but he has plainly declared that the human
    intellect, as at present constituted, can offer no solution.
    The greatest mind that this world has yet produced&mdash;the
    mind that systematized all human knowledge, that revolutionized
    modern science, that dissipated materialism forever, that
    revealed to us the ghostly unity of all existence, that
    reestablished all ethics upon an immutable and eternal
    foundation,&mdash;the mind that could expound with equal
    lucidity, and by the same universal formula, the history of a
    gnat or the history of a sun&mdash;confessed itself, before the
    Riddle of Existence, scarcely less helpless than the mind of a
    child.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>

    <p>But for me the supreme value of this last essay is made by
    the fact that in its pathetic statement of uncertainties and
    probabilities one can discern something very much resembling a
    declaration of faith. Though assured that we have yet no
    foundation for any belief in the persistence of consciousness
    after the death of the brain, we are bidden to remember that
    the ultimate nature of consciousness remains inscrutable.
    Though we cannot surmise the relation of consciousness to the
    unseen, we are reminded that it must be considered as a
    manifestation of the Infinite Energy, and that its elements, if
    dissociated by death, will return to the timeless and
    measureless Source of Life.... Science to-day also assures us
    that whatever existence has been&mdash;all individual life that
    ever moved in animal or plant,&mdash;all feeling and thought
    that ever stirred in human consciousness&mdash;must have
    flashed self-record beyond the sphere of sentiency; and though
    we cannot know, we cannot help imagining that the best of such
    registration may be destined to perpetuity. On this latter
    subject, for <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> obvious reasons, Herbert
       Spencer has remained silent; but the reader may ponder a
       remarkable paragraph in the final sixth edition of the
       "First Principles,"&mdash;a paragraph dealing with the
       hypothesis that consciousness may belong to the cosmic
       ether. This hypothesis has not been lightly dismissed by
       him; and even while proving its inadequacy, he seems to
       intimate that it may represent imperfectly some truth yet
       inapprehensible by the human mind:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The only supposition having consistency is that that in
        which consciousness inheres is the all-pervading ether.
        This we know can be affected by molecules of matter in
        motion, and conversely can affect the motions of
        molecules;&mdash;as witness the action of light on the
        retina. In pursuance of this supposition we may assume that
        the ether, which pervades not only all space but all
        matter, is, under special conditions in certain parts of
        the nervous system, capable of being affected by the
        nervous changes in such way as to result in feeling, and is
        reciprocally capable under these conditions of affecting
        the nervous changes. But if we accept this explanation, we
        must assume that the potentiality
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
           id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> of feeling is
           universal, and that the evolution of feeling in the
           ether takes place only under the extremely complex
           conditions occurring in certain nervous centres. This,
           however, is but a semblance of an explanation, since we
           know not what the ether is, and since, by confession of
           those most capable of judging, no hypothesis that has
           been framed accounts for all its powers. Such an
           explanation may be said to do no more than symbolize the
           phenomena by symbols of unknown natures."&mdash;["First
           Principles," § 71 <i>c</i>, definitive edition of
           1900.]</p>

        <p>&mdash;"Inscrutable is this complex consciousness which
        has slowly evolved out of infantine
        vacuity&mdash;consciousness which, in other shapes, is
        manifested by animate beings at large&mdash;consciousness
        which, during the development of every creature, makes its
        appearance out of what seems unconscious matter;
        <i>suggesting the thought that consciousness, in some
        rudimentary form, is omnipresent.</i>"<a id="footnotetag65"
           name="footnotetag65"></a><a href="#footnote65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>&mdash;Of all modern thinkers, Spencer was perhaps the most
    careful to avoid giving encouragement to any hypothesis
    unsupported <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span> by powerful evidence. Even
       the simple sum of his own creed is uttered only, with due
       reservation, as a statement of three probabilities: that
       consciousness represents a specialized and individualized
       form of the infinite Energy; that it is dissolved by death;
       and that its elements then return to the source of all
       being. As for our mental attitude toward the infinite
       Mystery, his advice is plain. We must resign ourselves to
       the eternal law, and endeavor to vanquish our ancient
       inheritance of superstitious terrors, remembering that,
       "merciless as is the Cosmic process worked out by an Unknown
       Power, yet vengeance is nowhere to be found in
       it."<a id="footnotetag66"
       name="footnotetag66"></a><a href="#footnote66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
    <hr />

    <p>In the same brief essay there is another confession of
    singular interest,&mdash;an acknowledgment of the terror of
    Space. To even the ordinary mind, the notion of infinite
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> Space, as forced upon us by
       those monstrous facts of astronomy which require no serious
       study to apprehend, is terrifying;&mdash;I mean the mere
       vague idea of that everlasting Night into which the blazing
       of millions of suns can bring neither light nor warmth. But
       to the intellect of Herbert Spencer the idea of Space must
       have presented itself after a manner incomparably more
       mysterious and stupendous. The mathematician alone will
       comprehend the full significance of the paragraph dealing
       with the Geometry of Position and the mystery of
       space-relations,&mdash;or the startling declaration that
       "even could we penetrate the mysteries of existence, there
       would remain still more transcendent mysteries." But Herbert
       Spencer tells us that, apart from the conception of these
       geometrical mysteries, the problem of naked Space itself
       became for him, in the twilight of his age, an obsession and
       a dismay:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>... "And then comes the thought of this universal matrix
        itself, anteceding alike creation or evolution, whichever
        be assumed, and infinitely
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
           id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> transcending both,
           alike in extent and duration; since both, if conceived
           at all, must be conceived as having had beginnings,
           while Space had no beginning. The thought of this blank
           form of existence which, explored in all directions as
           far as imagination can reach, has, beyond that, an
           unexplored region compared with which the part which
           imagination has traversed is but
           infinitesimal,&mdash;the thought of a Space compared
           with which our immeasurable sidereal system dwindles to
           a point is a thought too overwhelming to be dwelt upon.
           Of late years the consciousness that without origin or
           cause infinite Space has ever existed and must ever
           exist, produces in me a feeling from which I
           shrink."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <p>How the idea of infinite Space may affect a mind
    incomparably more powerful than my own, I cannot
    know;&mdash;neither can I divine the nature of certain problems
    which the laws of space-relation present to the geometrician.
    But when I try to determine the cause of the horror which that
    idea evokes within my own feeble imagination, I am able to
    distinguish different elements of the emotion,&mdash;particular
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
       id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span> forms of terror responding
       to particular ideas (rational and irrational) suggested by
       the revelations of science. One feeling&mdash;perhaps the
       main element of the horror&mdash;is made by the thought of
       being <i>prisoned</i> forever and ever within that
       unutterable Viewlessness which occupies infinite Space.</p>

    <p>Behind this feeling there is more than the thought of
    eternal circumscription;&mdash;there is also the idea of being
    perpetually penetrated, traversed, thrilled by the
    Nameless;&mdash;there is likewise the certainty that no least
    particle of innermost secret Self could shun the eternal touch
    of It;&mdash;there is furthermore the tremendous conviction
    that could the Self of me rush with the swiftness of
    light,&mdash;with more than the swiftness of
    light,&mdash;beyond all galaxies, beyond durations of time so
    vast that Science knows no sign by which their magnitudes might
    be indicated,&mdash;and still flee onward, onward, downward,
    upward,&mdash;always, always,&mdash;never could that Self of me
    reach nearer to any verge, never speed farther from any centre.
    For, in that Silence, all vastitude
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> and height and depth and
       time and direction are swallowed up: relation therein could
       have no meaning but for the speck of my fleeting
       consciousness,&mdash;atom of terror pulsating alone through
       atomless, soundless, nameless, illimitable potentiality.</p>

    <p>And the idea of that potentiality awakens another quality of
    horror,&mdash;the horror of infinite Possibility. For this
    Inscrutable that pulses through substance as if substance were
    not at all,&mdash;so subtly that none can feel the flowing of
    its tides, yet so swiftly that no life-time would suffice to
    count the number of the oscillations which it makes within the
    fraction of one second,&mdash;thrills to us out of
    endlessness;&mdash;and the force of infinity dwells in its
    lightest tremor; the weight of eternity presses behind its
    faintest shudder. To that phantom-Touch, the tinting of a
    blossom or the dissipation of a universe were equally facile:
    here it caresses the eye with the charm and illusion of color;
    there it bestirs into being a cluster of giant suns. All that
    human mind is capable of conceiving as possible (and how much
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> also that human mind must
       forever remain incapable of conceiving?) may be wrought
       anywhere, everywhere, by a single tremor of that
       Abyss....</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Is it true, as some would have us believe, that the fear of
    the extinction of self is the terror supreme?... For the
    thought of personal perpetuity in the infinite vortex is enough
    to evoke sudden trepidations that no tongue can
    utter,&mdash;fugitive instants of a horror too vast to enter
    wholly into consciousness: a horror that can be endured in
    swift black glimpsings only. And the trust that we are one with
    the Absolute&mdash;dim points of thrilling in the abyss of
    It&mdash;can prove a consoling faith only to those who find
    themselves obliged to think that consciousness dissolves with
    the crumbling of the brain.... It seems to me that few (or
    none) dare to utter frankly those stupendous doubts and fears
    which force mortal intelligence to recoil upon itself at every
    fresh attempt to pass the barrier of the Knowable. Were that
    barrier unexpectedly pushed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> back,&mdash;were knowledge
       to be suddenly and vastly expanded beyond its present
       limits,&mdash;perhaps we should find ourselves unable to
       endure the revelation....</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Mr. Percival Lowell's astonishing book, "Mars," sets one to
    thinking about the results of being able to hold communication
    with the habitants of an older and a wiser world,&mdash;some
    race of beings more highly evolved than we, both intellectually
    and morally, and able to interpret a thousand mysteries that
    still baffle our science. Perhaps, in such event, we should not
    find ourselves able to comprehend the methods, even could we
    borrow the results, of wisdom older than all our civilization
    by myriads or hundreds of myriads of years. But would not the
    sudden advent of larger knowledge from some elder planet prove
    for us, by reason, of the present moral condition of mankind,
    nothing less than a catastrophe?&mdash;might it not even result
    in the extinction of the human species?...</p>

    <p>The rule seems to be that the dissemination of dangerous
    higher knowledge, before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> the masses of a people are
       ethically prepared to receive it, will always be prevented
       by the conservative instinct; and we have reason to suppose
       (allowing for individual exceptions) that the power to gain
       higher knowledge is developed only as the moral ability to
       profit by such knowledge is evolved. I fancy that if the
       power of holding intellectual converse with other worlds
       could now serve us, we should presently obtain it. But if,
       by some astonishing chance,&mdash;as by the discovery, let
       us suppose, of some method of ether-telegraphy,&mdash;this
       power were prematurely acquired, its exercise would in all
       probability be prohibited.... Imagine, for example, what
       would have happened during the Middle Ages to the person
       guilty of discovering means to communicate with the people
       of a neighboring planet! Assuredly that inventor and his
       apparatus and his records would have been burned; every
       trace and memory of his labors would have been extirpated.
       Even to-day the sudden discovery of truths unsupported by
       human experience, the sudden revelation of facts totally
       opposed to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> existing convictions, might
       evoke some frantic revival of superstitious
       terrors,&mdash;some religious panic-fury that would strangle
       science, and replunge the world in mental darkness for a
       thousand years.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"

    <h2>THE MIRROR
    MAIDEN</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>

    <p>In the period of the Ashikaga Sh&#333;gunate the shrine of
    Ogawachi-My&#333;jin, at Minami-Isé, fell into decay; and the
    daimy&#333; of the district, the Lord Kitahataké, found himself
    unable, by reason of war and other circumstances, to provide
    for the reparation of the building. Then the Shint&#333; priest
    in charge, Matsumura Hy&#333;go, sought help at Ky&#333;to from
    the great daimy&#333; Hosokawa, who was known to have influence
    with the Sh&#333;gun. The Lord Hosokawa received the priest
    kindly, and promised to speak to the Sh&#333;gun about the
    condition of Ogawachi-My&#333;jin. But he said that, in any
    event, a grant for the restoration of the temple could not be
    made without due investigation and considerable
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"
       id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span> delay; and he advised
       Matsumura to remain in the capital while the matter was
       being arranged. Matsumura therefore brought his family to
       Ky&#333;to, and rented a house in the old Ky&#333;goku
       quarter.</p>

    <p>This house, although handsome and spacious, had been long
    unoccupied. It was said to be an unlucky house. On the
    northeast side of it there was a well; and several former
    tenants had drowned themselves in that well, without any known
    cause. But Matsumura, being a Shint&#333; priest, had no fear
    of evil spirits; and he soon made himself very comfortable in
    his new home.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In the summer of that year there was a great drought. For
    months no rain had fallen in the Five Home-Provinces; the
    river-beds dried up, the wells failed; and even in the capital
    there was a dearth of water. But the well in Matsumura's garden
    remained nearly full; and the water&mdash;which was very cold
    and clear, with a faint bluish tinge&mdash;seemed to be
    supplied by a spring. During the hot season many
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
       id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span> people came from all parts
       of the city to beg for water; and Matsumura allowed them to
       draw as much as they pleased. Nevertheless the supply did
       not appear to be diminished.</p>

    <p>But one morning the dead body of a young servant, who had
    been sent from a neighboring residence to fetch water, was
    found floating in the well. No cause for a suicide could be
    imagined; and Matsumura, remembering many unpleasant stories
    about the well, began to suspect some invisible malevolence. He
    went to examine the well, with the intention of having a fence
    built around it; and while standing there alone he was startled
    by a sudden motion in the water, as of something alive. The
    motion soon ceased; and then he perceived, clearly reflected in
    the still surface, the figure of a young woman, apparently
    about nineteen or twenty years of age. She seemed to be
    occupied with her toilet: he distinctly saw her touching her
    lips with <i>béni</i><a id="footnotetag67"
       name="footnotetag67"></a><a href="#footnote67"><sup>67</sup></a>
       At first her face was visible in profile only; but presently
       she turned towards him and smiled. Immediately he felt a
       strange shock <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span> at his heart, and a
       dizziness came upon him like the dizziness of wine, and
       everything became dark, except that smiling
       face,&mdash;white and beautiful as moonlight, and always
       seeming to grow more beautiful, and to be drawing him
       down&mdash;down&mdash;down into the darkness. But with a
       desperate effort he recovered his will and closed his eyes.
       When he opened them again, the face was gone, and the light
       had returned; and he found himself leaning down over the
       curb of the well. A moment more of that dizziness,&mdash;a
       moment more of that dazzling lure,&mdash;and he would never
       again have looked upon the sun...</p>

    <p>Returning to the house, he gave orders to his people not to
    approach the well under any circumstances, or allow any person
    to draw water from it. And the next day he had a strong fence
    built round the well.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>About a week after the fence had been built, the long
    drought was broken by a great rain-storm, accompanied by wind
    and lightning and thunder,&mdash;thunder so tremendous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> that the whole city shook
       to the rolling of it, as if shaken by an earthquake. For
       three days and three nights the downpour and the lightnings
       and the thunder continued; and the Kamogawa rose as it had
       never risen before, carrying away many bridges. During the
       third night of the storm, at the Hour of the Ox, there was
       heard a knocking at the door of the priest's dwelling, and
       the voice of a woman pleading for admittance. But Matsumura,
       warned by his experience at the well, forbade his servants
       to answer the appeal. He went himself to the entrance, and
       asked,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Who calls?"</p>

    <p>A feminine voice responded:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Pardon! it is I,&mdash;Yayoi!<a id="footnotetag68"
       name="footnotetag68"></a><a href="#footnote68"><sup>68</sup></a>...
       I have something to say to Matsumura Sama,&mdash;something
       of great moment. Please open!"...</p>

    <p>Matsumura half opened the door, very cautiously; and he saw
    the same beautiful face that had smiled upon him from the well.
    But it was not smiling now: it had a very sad look.</p>

    <p>"Into my house you shall not come,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
       id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span> the priest exclaimed. "You
       are not a human being, but a Well-Person.... Why do you thus
       wickedly try to delude and destroy people?"</p>

    <p>The Well-Person made answer in a voice musical as a tinkling
    of jewels (<i>tama-wo-korogasu-koë</i>.):&mdash;</p>

    <p>"It is of that very matter that I want to speak.... I have
    never wished to injure human beings. But from ancient time a
    Poison-Dragon dwelt in that well. He was the Master of the
    Well; and because of him the well was always full. Long ago I
    fell into the water there, and so became subject to him; and he
    had power to make me lure people to death, in order that he
    might drink their blood. But now the Heavenly Ruler has
    commanded the Dragon to dwell hereafter in the lake called
    Torii-no-Iké, in the Province of Shinsh&#363;; and the gods
    have decided that he shall never be allowed to return to this
    city. So to-night, after he had gone away, I was able to come
    out, to beg for your kindly help. There is now very little
    water in the well, because of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"
       id="page133"></a>[pg 133]</span> Dragon's departure; and if
       you will order search to be made, my body will be found
       there. I pray you to save my body from the well without
       delay; and I shall certainly return your
       benevolence."...</p>

    <p>So saying, she vanished into the night.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Before dawn the tempest had passed; and when the sun arose
    there was no trace of cloud in the pure blue sky. Matsumura
    sent at an early hour for well-cleaners to search the well.
    Then, to everybody's surprise, the well proved to be almost
    dry. It was easily cleaned; and at the bottom of it were found
    some hair-ornaments of a very ancient fashion, and a metal
    mirror of curious form&mdash;but no trace of any body, animal
    or human.</p>

    <p>Matusmura imagined, however, that the mirror might yield
    some explanation of the mystery; for every such mirror is a
    weird thing, having a soul of its own,&mdash;and the soul of a
    mirror is feminine. This mirror, which seemed to be very old,
    was deeply crusted with scurf. But when it had been carefully
    cleaned, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"
       id="page134"></a>[pg 134]</span> by the priest's order, it
       proved to be of rare and costly workmanship; and there were
       wonderful designs upon the back of it,&mdash;also several
       characters. Some of the characters had become
       indistinguishable; but there could still be discerned part
       of a date, and ideographs signifying, "<i>third month, the
       third day</i>." Now the third month used to be termed
       <i>Yayoi</i> (meaning, the Month of Increase); and the third
       day of the third month, which is a festival day, is still
       called <i>Yayoi-no-sekku</i>. Remembering that the
       Well-Person called herself "Yayoi," Matsumura felt almost
       sure that his ghostly visitant had been none other than the
       Soul of the Mirror.</p>

    <p>He therefore resolved to treat the mirror with all the
    consideration due to a Spirit. After having caused it to be
    carefully repolished and resilvered, he had a case of precious
    wood made for it, and a particular room in the house prepared
    to receive it. On the evening of the same day that it had been
    respectfully deposited in that room, Yayoi herself unexpectedly
    appeared before the priest as he sat alone in his study. She
    looked even more lovely than
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> before; but the light of
       her beauty was now soft as the light of a summer moon
       shining through pure white clouds. After having humbly
       saluted Matsumura, she said in her sweetly tinkling
       voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Now that you have saved me from solitude and sorrow, I have
    come to thank you.... I am indeed, as you supposed, the Spirit
    of the Mirror. It was in the time of the Emperor Saimei that I
    was first brought here from Kudara; and I dwelt in the august
    residence until the time of the Emperor Saga, when I was
    augustly bestowed upon the Lady Kamo, Naishinn&#333; of the
    Imperial Court.<a id="footnotetag69"
       name="footnotetag69"></a><a href="#footnote69"><sup>69</sup></a>
       Thereafter I became an heirloom in the House of Fuji-wara,
       and so remained until the period of H&#333;gen, when I was
       dropped into the well. There I was left and forgotten during
       the years <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> of the great
       war.<a id="footnotetag70"
       name="footnotetag70"></a><a href="#footnote70"><sup>70</sup></a>
       The Master of the Well<a id="footnotetag71"
       name="footnotetag71"></a><a href="#footnote71"><sup>71</sup></a>
       was a venomous Dragon, who used to live in a lake that once
       covered a great part of this district. After the lake had
       been filled in, by government order, in order that houses
       might be built upon the place of it, the Dragon took
       possession of the well; and when I fell into the well I
       became subject to him; and he compelled me to lure many
       people to their deaths. But the gods have banished him
       forever.... Now I have one more favor to beseech: I entreat
       that you will cause me to be offered up to the Sh&#333;gun,
       the Lord Yoshimasa, who by descent is related to my former
       possessors. Do me but this last great kindness, and it will
       bring you <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> good-fortune.... But I have
       also to warn you of a danger. In this house, after
       to-morrow, you must not stay, because it will be
       destroyed."... And with these words of warning Yayoi
       disappeared.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Matsumura was able to profit by this premonition. He removed
    his people and his belongings to another district the next day;
    and almost immediately afterwards another storm arose, even
    more violent than the first, causing a flood which swept away
    the house in which he had been residing.</p>

    <p>Some time later, by favor of the Lord Hosokawa, Matsumura
    was enabled to obtain an audience of the Sh&#333;gun Yoshimasa,
    to whom he presented the mirror, together with a written
    account of its wonderful history. Then the prediction of the
    Spirit of the Mirror was fulfilled; for the Sh&#333;gun,
    greatly pleased with this strange gift, not only bestowed
    costly presents upon Matsumura, but also made an ample grant of
    money for the rebuilding of the Temple of
    Ogawachi-My&#333;jin.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"

    <h2>THE STORY OF IT&#332;
    NORISUKÉ</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
       id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span>

    <p>In the town of Uji, in the province of Yamashiro, there
    lived, about six hundred years ago, a young samurai named
    It&#333; Tatéwaki Norisuké, whose ancestors were of the Héïké
    clan. It&#333; was of handsome person and amiable character, a
    good scholar and apt at arms. But his family were poor; and he
    had no patron among the military nobility,&mdash;so that his
    prospects were small. He lived in a very quiet way, devoting
    himself to the study of literature, and having (says the
    Japanese story-teller) "only the Moon and the Wind for
    friends."</p>

    <p>One autumn evening, as he was taking a solitary walk in the
    neighborhood of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
       id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> hill called Kotobikiyama,
       he happened to overtake a young girl who was following the
       same path. She was richly dressed, and seemed to be about
       eleven or twelve years old. It&#333; greeted her, and said,
       "The sun will soon be setting, damsel, and this is rather a
       lonesome place. May I ask if you have lost your way?" She
       looked up at him with a bright smile, and answered
       deprecatingly: "Nay! I am a
       <i>miya-dzukai</i>,<a id="footnotetag72"
       name="footnotetag72"></a><a href="#footnote72"><sup>72</sup></a>
       serving in this neighborhood; and I have only a little way
       to go."</p>

    <p>By her use of the term <i>miya-dzukai</i>, It&#333; knew
    that the girl must be in the service of persons of rank; and
    her statement surprised him, because he had never heard of any
    family of distinction residing in that vicinity. But he only
    said: "I am returning to Uji, where my home is. Perhaps you
    will allow me to accompany you on the way, as this is a very
    lonesome place." She thanked him gracefully, seeming pleased by
    his offer; and they walked on together, chatting as they went.
    She talked about the weather, the flowers, the butterflies,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
       id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> and the birds; about a
       visit that she had once made to Uji, about the famous sights
       of the capital, where she had been born;&mdash;and the
       moments passed pleasantly for It&#333;, as he listened to
       her fresh prattle. Presently, at a turn in the road, they
       entered a hamlet, densely shadowed by a grove of young
       trees.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>[Here I must interrupt the story to tell you that, without
    having actually seen them, you cannot imagine how dark some
    Japanese country villages remain even in the brightest and
    hottest weather. In the neighborhood of T&#333;ky&#333; itself
    there are many villages of this kind. At a short distance from
    such a settlement you see no houses: nothing is visible but a
    dense grove of evergreen trees. The grove, which is usually
    composed of young cedars and bamboos, serves to shelter the
    village from storms, and also to supply timber for various
    purposes. So closely are the trees planted that there is no
    room to pass between the trunks of them: they stand straight as
    masts, and mingle their crests so as to form a roof that
    excludes <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"
       id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span> the sun. Each thatched
       cottage occupies a clear space in the plantation, the trees
       forming a fence about it, double the height of the building.
       Under the trees it is always twilight, even at high noon;
       and the houses, morning or evening, are half in shadow. What
       makes the first impression of such a village almost
       disquieting is, not the transparent gloom, which has a
       certain weird charm of its own, but the stillness. There may
       be fifty or a hundred dwellings; but you see nobody; and you
       hear no sound but the twitter of invisible birds, the
       occasional crowing of cocks, and the shrilling of cicadæ.
       Even the cicadæ, however, find these groves too dim, and
       sing faintly; being sun-lovers, they prefer the trees
       outside the village. I forgot to say that you may sometimes
       hear a viewless shuttle&mdash;<i>chaka-ton,
       chaka-ton</i>;&mdash;but that familiar sound, in the great
       green silence, seems an elfish happening. The reason of the
       hush is simply that the people are not at home. All the
       adults, excepting some feeble elders, have gone to the
       neighboring fields, the women carrying their babies on their
       backs; and most <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span> of the children have gone
       to the nearest school, perhaps not less than a mile away.
       Verily, in these dim hushed villages, one seems to behold
       the mysterious perpetuation of conditions recorded in the
       texts of Kwang-Tze:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>The ancients who had the nourishment of the world
        wished for nothing, and the world had enough:&mdash;they
        did nothing, and all things were transformed:&mdash;their
        stillness was abysmal, and the people were all
        composed.</i>"]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <p>... The village was very dark when It&#333; reached it; for
    the sun had set, and the after-glow made no twilight in the
    shadowing of the trees. "Now, kind sir," the child said,
    pointing to a narrow lane opening upon the main road, "I have
    to go this way." "Permit me, then, to see you home," It&#333;
    responded; and he turned into the lane with her, feeling rather
    than seeing his way. But the girl soon stopped before a small
    gate, dimly visible in the gloom,&mdash;a gate of trelliswork,
    beyond which the lights of a dwelling could be seen. "Here,"
    she said, "is the honorable residence in which I serve.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
       id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span> As you have come thus far
       out of your way, kind sir, will you not deign to enter and
       to rest a while?" It&#333; assented. He was pleased by the
       informal invitation; and he wished to learn what persons of
       superior condition had chosen to reside in so lonesome a
       village. He knew that sometimes a family of rank would
       retire in this manner from public life, by reason of
       government displeasure or political trouble; and he imagined
       that such might be the history of the occupants of the
       dwelling before him. Passing the gate, which his young guide
       opened for him, he found himself in a large quaint garden. A
       miniature landscape, traversed by a winding stream, was
       faintly distinguishable. "Deign for one little moment to
       wait," the child said; "I go to announce the honorable
       coming;" and hurried toward the house. It was a spacious
       house, but seemed very old, and built in the fashion of
       another time. The sliding doors were not closed; but the
       lighted interior was concealed by a beautiful bamboo curtain
       extending along the gallery front. Behind it shadows were
       moving&mdash;shadows of women;&mdash;and suddenly
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
       id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> the music of a <i>koto</i>
       rippled into the night. So light and sweet was the playing
       that It&#333; could scarcely believe the evidence of his
       senses. A slumbrous feeling of delight stole over him as he
       listened,&mdash;a delight strangely mingled with sadness. He
       wondered how any woman could have learned to play
       thus,&mdash;wondered whether the player could be a
       woman,&mdash;wondered even whether he was hearing earthly
       music; for enchantment seemed to have entered into his blood
       with the sound of it.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The soft music ceased; and almost at the same moment
    It&#333; found the little <i>miya-dzukai</i> beside him. "Sir,"
    she said, "it is requested that you will honorably enter." She
    conducted him to the entrance, where he removed his sandals;
    and an aged woman, whom he thought to be the <i>R&#333;jo</i>,
    or matron of the household, came to welcome him at the
    threshold. The old woman then led him through many apartments
    to a large and well-lighted room in the rear of the house, and
    with many respectful salutations requested him to take the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"
       id="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span> place of honor accorded to
       guests of distinction. He was surprised by the stateliness
       of the chamber, and the curious beauty of its decorations.
       Presently some maid-servants brought refreshments; and he
       noticed that the cups and other vessels set before him were
       of rare and costly workmanship, and ornamented with a design
       indicating the high rank of the possessor. More and more he
       wondered what noble person had chosen this lonely retreat,
       and what happening could have inspired the wish for such
       solitude. But the aged attendant suddenly interrupted his
       reflections with the question:</p>

    <p>"Am I wrong in supposing that you are It&#333; Sama, of
    Uji,&mdash;It&#333; Tatéwaki Norisuké?"</p>

    <p>It&#333; bowed in assent. He had not told his name to the
    little <i>miya-dzukai</i>, and the manner of the inquiry
    startled him.</p>

    <p>"Please do not think my question rude," continued the
    attendant. "An old woman like myself may ask questions without
    improper curiosity. When you came to the house, I thought that
    I knew your face; and I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> asked your name only to
       clear away all doubt, before speaking of other matters. I
       have some thing of moment to tell you. You often pass
       through this village, and our young
       Himégimi-Sama<a id="footnotetag73"
       name="footnotetag73"></a><a href="#footnote73"><sup>73</sup></a>
       happened one morning to see you going by; and ever since
       that moment she has been thinking about you, day and night.
       Indeed, she thought so much that she became ill; and we have
       been very uneasy about her. For that reason I took means to
       find out your name and residence; and I was on the point of
       sending you a letter when&mdash;so unexpectedly!&mdash;you
       came to our gate with the little attendant. Now, to say how
       happy I am to see you is not possible; it seems almost too
       fortunate a happening to be true! Really I think that this
       meeting must have been brought about by the favor of
       Enmusubi-no-Kami,&mdash;that great God of Izumo who ties the
       knots of fortunate union. And now that so lucky a destiny
       has led you hither, perhaps you will not refuse&mdash;if
       there <span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"
       id="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span> be no obstacle in the way
       of such a union&mdash;to make happy the heart of our
       Himégimi-Sama?"</p>

    <p>For the moment It&#333; did not know how to reply. If the
    old woman had spoken the truth, an extraordinary chance was
    being offered to him. Only a great passion could impel the
    daughter of a noble house to seek, of her own will, the
    affection of an obscure and masterless samurai, possessing
    neither wealth nor any sort of prospects. On the other hand, it
    was not in the honorable nature of the man to further his own
    interests by taking advantage of a feminine weakness. Moreover,
    the circumstances were disquietingly mysterious. Yet how to
    decline the proposal, so unexpectedly made, troubled him not a
    little. After a short silence, he replied:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"There would be no obstacle, as I have no wife, and no
    betrothed, and no relation with any woman. Until now I have
    lived with my parents; and the matter of my marriage was never
    discussed by them. You must know that I am a poor samurai,
    without any patron among persons of rank; and I did not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"
       id="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span> wish to marry until I could
       find some chance to improve my condition. As to the proposal
       which you have done me the very great honor to make, I can
       only say that I know myself yet unworthy of the notice of
       any noble maiden."</p>

    <p>The old woman smiled as if pleased by these words, and
    responded:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Until you have seen our Himégimi-Sama, it were better that
    you make no decision. Perhaps you will feel no hesitation after
    you have seen her. Deign now to come with me, that I may
    present you to her."</p>

    <p>She conducted him to another larger guest-room, where
    preparations for a feast had been made, and having shown him
    the place of honor, left him for a moment alone. She returned
    accompanied by the Himégimi-Sama; and, at the first sight of
    the young mistress, It&#333; felt again the strange thrill of
    wonder and delight that had come to him in the garden, as he
    listened to the music of the <i>koto</i>. Never had he dreamed
    of so beautiful a being. Light seemed to radiate from her
    presence, and to shine through her garments, as the light of
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152"
       id="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span> moon through flossy clouds;
       her loosely flowing hair swayed about her as she moved, like
       the boughs of the drooping willow bestirred by the breezes
       of spring; her lips were like flowers of the peach
       besprinkled with morning dew. It&#333; was bewildered by the
       vision. He asked himself whether he was not looking upon the
       person of Amano-kawara-no-Ori-Himé herself,&mdash;the
       Weaving-Maiden who dwells by the shining River of
       Heaven.</p>

    <p>Smiling, the aged woman turned to the fair one, who remained
    speechless, with downcast eyes and flushing cheeks, and said to
    her:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"See, my child!&mdash;at the moment when we could least have
    hoped for such a thing, the very person whom you wished to meet
    has come of his own accord. So fortunate a happening could have
    been brought about only by the will of the high gods. To think
    of it makes me weep for joy." And she sobbed aloud. "But now,"
    she continued, wiping away her tears with her sleeve, "it only
    remains for you both&mdash;unless either prove unwilling,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
       id="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span> which I doubt&mdash;to
       pledge yourselves to each other, and to partake of your
       wedding feast."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It&#333; answered by no word: the incomparable vision before
    him had numbed his will and tied his tongue. Maid-servants
    entered, bearing dishes and wine: the wedding feast was spread
    before the pair; and the pledges were given. It&#333;
    nevertheless remained as in a trance: the marvel of the
    adventure, and the wonder of the beauty of the bride, still
    bewildered him. A gladness, beyond aught that he had ever known
    before, filled his heart&mdash;like a great silence. But
    gradually he recovered his wonted calm; and thereafter he found
    himself able to converse without embarrassment. Of the wine he
    partook freely; and he ventured to speak, in a
    self-depreciating but merry way, about the doubts and fears
    that had oppressed him. Meanwhile the bride remained still as
    moonlight, never lifting her eyes, and replying only by a blush
    or a smile when he addressed her.</p>

    <p>It&#333; said to the aged attendant:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Many times, in my solitary walks, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
       id="page154"></a>[pg 154]</span> have passed through this
       village without knowing of the existence of this honorable
       dwelling. And ever since entering here, I have been
       wondering why this noble household should have chosen so
       lonesome a place of sojourn.... Now that your Himégimi-Sama
       and I have become pledged to each other, it seems to me a
       strange thing that I do not yet know the name of her august
       family."</p>

    <p>At this utterance, a shadow passed over the kindly face of
    the old woman; and the bride, who had yet hardly spoken, turned
    pale, and appeared to become painfully anxious. After some
    moments of silence, the aged woman responded:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"To keep our secret from you much longer would be difficult;
    and I think that, under any circumstances, you should be made
    aware of the facts, now that you are one of us. Know then, Sir
    It&#333;, that your bride is the daughter of
    Shigéhira-Ky&#333;, the great and unfortunate San-mi
    Chüj&#333;."</p>

    <p>At those words&mdash;"Shigéhira-Ky&#333;, San-mi
    Chüj&#333;"&mdash;the young samurai felt a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"
       id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span> chill, as of ice, strike
       through all his veins. Shigéhira-Ky&#333;, the great Héïké
       general and statesman, had been dust for centuries. And
       It&#333; suddenly understood that everything around
       him&mdash;the chamber and the lights and the
       banquet&mdash;was a dream of the past; that the forms before
       him were not people, but shadows of people dead.</p>

    <p>But in another instant the icy chill had passed; and the
    charm returned, and seemed to deepen about him; and he felt no
    fear. Though his bride had come to him out of Yomi,&mdash;out
    of the place of the Yellow Springs of death,&mdash;his heart
    had been wholly won. Who weds a ghost must become a
    ghost;&mdash;yet he knew himself ready to die, not once, but
    many times, rather than betray by word or look one thought that
    might bring a shadow of pain to the brow of the beautiful
    illusion before him. Of the affection proffered he had no
    misgiving: the truth had been told him when any unloving
    purpose might better have been served by deception. But these
    thoughts and emotions passed in a flash, leaving him resolved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"
       id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span> to accept the strange
       situation as it had presented itself, and to act just as he
       would have done if chosen, in the years of Jü-ei, by
       Shigéhira's daughter.</p>

    <p>"Ah, the pity of it!" he exclaimed; "I have heard of the
    cruel fate of the august Lord Shigéhira."</p>

    <p>"Ay," responded the aged woman, sobbing as she
    spoke;&mdash;"it was indeed a cruel fate. His horse, you know,
    was killed by an arrow, and fell upon him; and when he called
    for help, those who had lived upon his bounty deserted him in
    his need. Then he was taken prisoner, and sent to Kamakura,
    where they treated him shamefully, and at last put him to
    death.<a id="footnotetag74"
       name="footnotetag74"></a><a href="#footnote74"><sup>74</sup></a>
       His wife and child&mdash;this dear maid
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
       id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span> here&mdash;were then in
       hiding; for everywhere the Héïké were being sought out and
       killed. When the news of the Lord Shigéhira's death reached
       us, the pain proved too great for the mother to bear, so the
       child was left with no one to care for her but
       me,&mdash;since her kindred had all perished or disappeared.
       She was only five years old. I had been her milk-nurse, and
       I did what I could for her. Year after year we wandered from
       place to place, traveling in pilgrim-garb.... But these
       tales of grief are ill-timed," exclaimed the nurse, wiping
       away her tears;&mdash;"pardon the foolish heart of an old
       woman who cannot forget the past. See! the little maid whom
       I fostered has now become a Himégimi-Sama indeed!&mdash;were
       we living in the good days of the Emperor Takakura, what a
       destiny might be reserved for her! However, she has obtained
       the husband <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
       id="page158"></a>[pg 158]</span> whom she desired; that is
       the greatest happiness.... But the hour is late. The
       bridal-chamber has been prepared; and I must now leave you
       to care for each other until morning."</p>

    <p>She rose, and sliding back the screens parting the
    guest-room from the adjoining chamber, ushered them to their
    sleeping apartment. Then, with many words of joy and
    congratulation, she withdrew; and It&#333; was left alone with
    his bride.</p>

    <p>As they reposed together, It&#333; said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Tell me, my loved one, when was it that you first wished to
    have me for your husband."</p>

    <p>(For everything appeared so real that he had almost ceased
    to think of the illusion woven around him.)</p>

    <p>She answered, in a voice like a dove's voice:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My august lord and husband, it was at the temple of
    Ishiyama, where I went with my foster-mother, that I saw you
    for the first time. And because of seeing you, the world became
    changed to me from that hour and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page159"
       id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span> moment. But you do not
       remember, because our meeting was not in this, your present
       life: it was very, very long ago. Since that time you have
       passed through many deaths and births, and have had many
       comely bodies. But I have remained always that which you see
       me now: I could not obtain another body, nor enter into
       another state of existence, because of my great wish for
       you. My dear lord and husband, I have waited for you through
       many ages of men."</p>

    <p>And the bridegroom felt nowise afraid at hearing these
    strange words, but desired nothing more in life, or in all his
    lives to come, than to feel her arms about him, and to hear the
    caress of her voice.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>But the pealing of a temple-bell proclaimed the coming of
    dawn. Birds began to twitter; a morning breeze set all the
    trees a-whispering. Suddenly the old nurse pushed apart the
    sliding screens of the bridal-chamber, and
    exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My children, it is time to separate! By daylight you must
    not be together, even for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
       id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span> an instant: that were
       fatal! You must bid each other good-by."</p>

    <p>Without a word, It&#333; made ready to depart. He vaguely
    understood the warning uttered, and resigned himself wholly to
    destiny. His will belonged to him no more; he desired only to
    please his shadowy bride.</p>

    <p>She placed in his hands a little <i>suzuri</i>, or
    ink-stone, curiously carved, and said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"My young lord and husband is a scholar; therefore this
    small gift will probably not be despised by him. It is of
    strange fashion because it is old, having been augustly
    bestowed upon my father by the favor of the Emperor Takakura.
    For that reason only, I thought it to be a precious thing."</p>

    <p>It&#333;, in return, besought her to accept for a
    remembrance the <i>k&#333;gai</i><a id="footnotetag75"
       name="footnotetag75"></a><a href="#footnote75"><sup>75</sup></a>
       of his sword, which were decorated with inlaid work of
       silver and gold, representing plum-flowers and
       nightingales.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
       id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>

    <p>Then the little <i>miya-dzukai</i> came to guide him through
    the garden, and his bride with her foster-mother accompanied
    him to the threshold.</p>

    <p>As he turned at the foot of the steps to make his parting
    salute, the old woman said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"We shall meet again the next Year of the Boar, at the same
    hour of the same day of the same month that you came here. This
    being the Year of the Tiger, you will have to wait ten years.
    But, for reasons which I must not say, we shall not be able to
    meet again in this place; we are going to the neighborhood of
    Ky&#333;to, where the good Emperor Takakura and our fathers and
    many of our people are dwelling. All the Héïké will be rejoiced
    by your coming. We shall send a
    <i>kago</i><a id="footnotetag76"
       name="footnotetag76"></a><a href="#footnote76"><sup>76</sup></a>
       for you on the appointed day."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Above the village the stars were burning as It&#333; passed
    the gate; but on reaching the open road he saw the dawn
    brightening beyond <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"
       id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span> leagues of silent fields.
       In his bosom he carried the gift of his bride. The charm of
       her voice lingered in his ears,&mdash;and nevertheless, had
       it not been for the memento which he touched with
       questioning fingers, he could have persuaded himself that
       the memories of the night were memories of sleep, and that
       his life still belonged to him.</p>

    <p>But the certainty that he had doomed himself evoked no least
    regret: he was troubled only by the pain of separation, and the
    thought of the seasons that would have to pass before the
    illusion could be renewed for him. Ten years!&mdash;and every
    day of those years would seem how long! The mystery of the
    delay he could not hope to solve; the secret ways of the dead
    are known to the gods alone.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Often and often, in his solitary walks, It&#333; revisited
    the village at Kotobikiyama, vaguely hoping to obtain another
    glimpse of the past. But never again, by night or by day, was
    he able to find the rustic gate in the shadowed lane; never
    again could he perceive the figure
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"
       id="page163"></a>[pg 163]</span> of the little
       <i>miya-dzukai</i>, walking alone in the sunset-glow.</p>

    <p>The village people, whom he questioned carefully, thought
    him bewitched. No person of rank, they said, had ever dwelt in
    the settlement; and there had never been, in the neighborhood,
    any such garden as he described. But there had once been a
    great Buddhist temple near the place of which he spoke; and
    some gravestones of the temple-cemetery were still to be seen.
    It&#333; discovered the monuments in the middle of a dense
    thicket. They were of an ancient Chinese form, and were covered
    with moss and lichens. The characters that had been cut upon
    them could no longer be deciphered.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Of his adventure It&#333; spoke to no one. But friends and
    kindred soon perceived a great change in his appearance and
    manner. Day by day he seemed to become more pale and thin,
    though physicians declared that he had no bodily ailment; he
    looked like a ghost, and moved like a shadow. Thoughtful and
    solitary he had always been, but now he appeared indifferent
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
       id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span> to everything which had
       formerly given him pleasure,&mdash;even to those literary
       studies by means of which he might have hoped to win
       distinction. To his mother&mdash;who thought that marriage
       might quicken his former ambition, and revive his interest
       in life&mdash;he said that he had made a vow to marry no
       living woman. And the months dragged by.</p>

    <p>At last came the Year of the Boar, and the season of autumn;
    but I to could no longer take the solitary walks that he loved.
    He could not even rise from his bed. His life was ebbing,
    though none could divine the cause; and he slept so deeply and
    so long that his sleep was often mistaken for death.</p>

    <p>Out of such a sleep he was startled, one bright evening, by
    the voice of a child; and he saw at his bedside the little
    <i>miya-dsukai</i> who had guided him, ten years before, to the
    gate of the vanished garden. She saluted him, and smiled, and
    said: "I am bidden to tell you that you will be received
    to-night at Öhara, near Ky&#333;to, where the new home is, and
    that a <i>kago</i> has been sent for you." Then she
    disappeared.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"
       id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>

    <p>It&#333; knew that he was being summoned away from the light
    of the sun; but the message so rejoiced him that he found
    strength to sit up and call his mother. To her he then for the
    first time related the story of his bridal, and he showed her
    the ink-stone which had been given him. He asked that it should
    be placed in his coffin,&mdash;and then he died.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The ink-stone was buried with him. But before the funeral
    ceremonies it was examined by experts, who said that it had
    been made in the period of <i>J&#333;-an</i>(1169 A.D.), and
    that it bore the seal-mark of an artist who had lived in the
    time of the Emperor
    Takakura.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"

    <h2>STRANGER THAN
    FICTION</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
       id="page169"></a>[pg 169]</span>

    <p>It was a perfect West Indian day. My friend the notary and I
    were crossing the island by a wonderful road which wound up
    through tropic forest to the clouds, and thence looped down
    again, through gold-green slopes of cane, and scenery amazing
    of violet and blue and ghost-gray peaks, to the roaring coast
    of the trade winds. All the morning we had been
    ascending,&mdash;walking after our carriage, most of the time,
    for the sake of the brave little mule;&mdash;and the sea had
    been climbing behind us till it looked like a monstrous wall of
    blue, pansy-blue, under the ever heightening horizon. The heat
    was like the heat of a vapor-bath, but the air was good to
    breathe with its tropical odor,&mdash;an odor made up of smells
    of strange <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"
       id="page170"></a>[pg 170]</span> saps, queer spicy scents of
       mould, exhalations of aromatic decay. Moreover, the views
       were glimpses of Paradise; and it was a joy to watch the
       torrents roaring down their gorges under shadows of
       tree-fern and bamboo.</p>

    <p>My friend stopped the carriage before a gateway set into a
    hedge full of flowers that looked like pink-and-white
    butterflies. "I have to make a call here," he said;&mdash;"come
    in with me." We dismounted, and he knocked on the gate with the
    butt of his whip. Within, at the end of a shady garden, I could
    see the porch of a planter's house; beyond were rows of cocoa
    palms, and glimpses of yellowing cane. Presently a negro,
    wearing only a pair of canvas trousers and a great straw hat,
    came hobbling to open the gate,&mdash;followed by a multitude,
    an astonishing multitude, of chippering chickens. Under the
    shadow of that huge straw hat I could not see the negro's face;
    but I noticed that his limbs and body were strangely
    shrunken,&mdash;looked as if withered to the bone. A weirder
    creature I had never beheld; and I wondered at his following of
    chickens.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171"
       id="page171"></a>[pg 171]</span>

    <p>"Eh!" exclaimed the notary, "your chickens are as lively as
    ever!... I want to see Madame Floran."</p>

    <p>"<i>Moin ké di</i>," the goblin responded huskily, in his
    patois; and he limped on before us, all the chickens hopping
    and cheeping at his withered heels.</p>

    <p>"That fellow," my friend observed, "was bitten by a
    <i>fer-de-lance</i> about eight or nine years ago. He got
    cured, or at least half-cured, in some extraordinary way; but
    ever since then he has been a skeleton. See how he limps!"</p>

    <p>The skeleton passed out of sight behind the house, and we
    waited a while at the front porch. Then a
    métisse&mdash;turbaned in wasp colors, and robed in iris
    colors, and wonderful to behold&mdash;came to tell us that
    Madame hoped we would rest ourselves in the garden, as the
    house was very warm. Chairs and a little table were then set
    for us in a shady place, and the métisse brought out lemons,
    sugar-syrup, a bottle of the clear plantation rum that smells
    like apple juice, and ice-cold water in a <i>dobanne</i> of
    thick red clay. My friend prepared the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"
       id="page172"></a>[pg 172]</span> refreshments; and then our
       hostess came to greet us, and to sit with us,&mdash;a nice
       old lady with hair like newly minted silver. I had never
       seen a smile sweeter than that with which she bade us
       welcome; and I wondered whether she could ever have been
       more charming in her Creole girlhood than she now
       appeared,&mdash;with her kindly wrinkles, and argent hair,
       and frank, black, sparkling eyes....</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In the conversation that followed I was not able to take
    part, as it related only to some question of title. The notary
    soon arranged whatever there was to arrange; and, after some
    charmingly spoken words of farewell from the gentle lady, we
    took our departure. Again the mummified negro hobbled before
    us, to open the gate,&mdash;followed by all his callow rabble
    of chickens. As we resumed our places in the carriage we could
    still hear the chippering of the creatures, pursuing after that
    ancient scarecrow.</p>

    <p>"Is it African sorcery?" I queried.... "How does he bewitch
    those chickens?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
       id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>

    <p>"Queer&mdash;is it not?" the notary responded as we drove
    away. "That negro must now be at least eighty years old; and he
    may live for twenty years more,&mdash;the wretch!"</p>

    <p>The tone in which my friend uttered this epithet&mdash;<i>le
    miserable!</i>&mdash;somewhat surprised me, as I knew him to be
    one of the kindliest men in the world, and singularly free from
    prejudice. I suspected that a story was coming, and I waited
    for it in silence.</p>

    <p>"Listen," said the notary, after a pause, during which we
    left the plantation well behind us; "that old sorcerer, as you
    call him, was born upon the estate, a slave. The estate
    belonged to M. Floran,&mdash;the husband of the lady whom we
    visited; and she was a cousin, and the marriage was a
    love-match. They had been married about two years when the
    revolt occurred (fortunately there were no children),&mdash;the
    black revolt of eighteen hundred and forty-eight. Several
    planters were murdered; and M. Floran was one of the first to
    be killed. And the old negro whom we saw to-day&mdash;the old
    sorcerer, as you call him&mdash;left the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"
       id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span> plantation, and joined the
       rising: do you understand?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," I said; "but he might have done that through fear of
    the mob."</p>

    <p>"Certainly: the other hands did the same. But it was he that
    killed M. Floran,&mdash;for no reason whatever,&mdash;cut him
    up with a cutlass. M. Floran was riding home when the attack
    was made,&mdash;about a mile below the plantation.... Sober,
    that negro would not have dared to face M. Floran: the
    scoundrel was drunk, of course,&mdash;raving drunk. Most of the
    blacks had been drinking tafia, with dead wasps in it, to give
    themselves courage."</p>

    <p>"But," I interrupted, "how does it happen that the fellow is
    still on the Floran plantation?"</p>

    <p>"Wait a moment!... When the military got control of the mob,
    search was made everywhere for the murderer of M. Floran; but
    he could not be found. He was lying out in the cane,&mdash;in
    M. Floran's cane!&mdash;like a field-rat, like a snake. One
    morning, while the gendarmes were still looking for him, he
    rushed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"
       id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span> into the house, and threw
       himself down in front of Madame, weeping and screaming,
       '<i>Aïe-yaïe-yaïe-yaïe!&mdash;moin té tchoué y! moin té
       tchoué y!&mdash;aïe-yaïe-yaïe!</i>' Those were his very
       words:&mdash;'I killed him! I killed him!' And he begged for
       mercy. When he was asked why he killed M. Floran, he cried
       out that it was the devil&mdash;<i>diabe-à</i>&mdash;that
       had made him do it!... Well, Madame forgave him!"</p>

    <p>"But how could she?" I queried.</p>

    <p>"Oh, she had always been very religious," my friend
    responded,&mdash;"sincerely religious. She only said, 'May God
    pardon me as I now pardon you!' She made her servants hide the
    creature and feed him; and they kept him hidden until the
    excitement was over. Then she sent him back to work; and he has
    been working for her ever since. Of course he is now too old to
    be of any use in the field;&mdash;he only takes care of the
    chickens."</p>

    <p>"But how," I persisted, "could the relatives allow Madame to
    forgive him?"</p>

    <p>"Well, Madame insisted that he was not mentally
    responsible,&mdash;that he was only a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"
       id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span> poor fool who had killed
       without knowing what he was doing; and she argued that if
       <i>she</i> could forgive him, others could more easily do
       the same. There was a consultation; and the relatives
       decided so to arrange matters that Madame could have her own
       way."</p>

    <p>"But why?"</p>

    <p>"Because they knew that she found a sort of religious
    consolation&mdash;a kind of religious comfort&mdash;in
    forgiving the wretch. She imagined that it was her duty as a
    Christian, not only to forgive him, but to take care of him. We
    thought that she was mistaken,&mdash;but we could
    understand.... Well, there is an example of what religion can
    do."...</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The surprise of a new fact, or the sudden perception of
    something never before imagined, may cause an involuntary
    smile. Unconsciously I smiled, while my friend was yet
    speaking; and the good notary's brow darkened.</p>

    <p>"Ah, you laugh!" he exclaimed,&mdash;"you laugh! That is
    wrong!&mdash;that is a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
       id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span> mistake!... But you do not
       believe: you do not know what it is,&mdash;the true
       religion,&mdash;the real Christianity!"</p>

    <p>Earnestly I made answer:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Pardon me! I do believe every word of what you have told
    me. If I laughed unthinkingly, it was only because I could not
    help wondering" ...</p>

    <p>"At what?" he questioned gravely.</p>

    <p>"At the marvelous instinct of that negro."</p>

    <p>"Ah, yes!" he returned approvingly. "Yes, the cunning of the
    animal it was,&mdash;the instinct of the brute!... She was the
    only person in the world who could have saved him."</p>

    <p>"And he knew it," I ventured to add.</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;no!" my friend emphatically
    dissented,&mdash;"he never could have known it! He only
    <i>felt</i> it!... Find me an instinct like that, and I will
    show you a brain incapable of any knowledge, any thinking, any
    understanding: not the mind of a man, but the brain of a
    beast!"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"

    <h2>A LETTER FROM
    JAPAN</h2><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"
       id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>

    <p>Tokyo, August 1, 1904.</p>

    <p>Here, in this quiet suburb, where the green peace is broken
    only by the voices of children at play and the shrilling of
    cicadæ, it is difficult to imagine that, a few hundred miles
    away, there is being carried on one of the most tremendous wars
    of modern times, between armies aggregating more than half a
    million of men, or that, on the intervening sea, a hundred
    ships of war have been battling. This contest, between the
    mightiest of Western powers and a people that began to study
    Western science only within the recollection of many persons
    still in vigorous life, is, on one side at least, a struggle
    for national existence. It was inevitable,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"
       id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span> this struggle,&mdash;might
       perhaps have been delayed, but certainly not averted. Japan
       has boldly challenged an empire capable of threatening
       simultaneously the civilizations of the East and the
       West,&mdash;a mediæval power that, unless vigorously
       checked, seems destined to absorb Scandinavia and to
       dominate China. For all industrial civilization the contest
       is one of vast moment;&mdash;for Japan it is probably the
       supreme crisis in her national life. As to what her fleets
       and her armies have been doing, the world is fully informed;
       but as to what her people are doing at home, little has been
       written.</p>

    <p>To inexperienced observation they would appear to be doing
    nothing unusual; and this strange calm is worthy of record. At
    the beginning of hostilities an Imperial mandate was issued,
    bidding all non-combatants to pursue their avocations as usual,
    and to trouble themselves as little as possible about exterior
    events;&mdash;and this command has been obeyed to the letter.
    It would be natural to suppose that all the sacrifices,
    tragedies, and uncertainties of the contest had thrown their
    gloom over the life of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"
       id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span> the capital in especial;
       but there is really nothing whatever to indicate a condition
       of anxiety or depression. On the contrary, one is astonished
       by the joyous tone of public confidence, and the admirably
       restrained pride of the nation in its victories. Western
       tides have strewn the coast with Japanese corpses; regiments
       have been blown out of existence in the storming of
       positions defended by wire-entanglements; battleships have
       been lost: yet at no moment has there been the least public
       excitement. The people are following their daily occupations
       just as they did before the war; the cheery aspect of things
       is just the same; the theatres and flower displays are not
       less well patronized. The life of T&#333;ky&#333; has been,
       to outward seeming, hardly more affected by the events of
       the war than the life of nature beyond it, where the flowers
       are blooming and the butterflies hovering as in other
       summers. Except after the news of some great
       victory,&mdash;celebrated with fireworks and lantern
       processions,&mdash;there are no signs of public emotion; and
       but for the frequent distribution of newspaper extras, by
       runners ringing bells, you
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"
       id="page184"></a>[pg 184]</span> could almost persuade
       yourself that the whole story of the war is an evil
       dream.</p>

    <p>Yet there has been, of necessity, a vast amount of
    suffering&mdash;viewless and voiceless
    suffering&mdash;repressed by that sense of social and patriotic
    duty which is Japanese religion. As a seventeen-syllable poem
    of the hour tells us, the news of every victory must bring pain
    as well as joy:&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i2">G&#333;gwai no</p>

            <p>Tabi teki mikata</p>

            <p class="i2">Goké ga fuè.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>Each time that an extra is circulated the widows of
        foes and friends have increased in multitude.</i>]</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The great quiet and the smiling tearlessness testify to the
    more than Spartan discipline of the race. Anciently the people
    were trained, not only to conceal their emotions, but to speak
    in a cheerful voice and to show a pleasant face under any
    stress of moral suffering; and they are obedient to that
    teaching to-day. It would still be thought a shame to betray
    personal <span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"
       id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> sorrow for the loss of
       those who die for Emperor and fatherland. The public seem to
       view the events of the war as they would watch the scenes of
       a popular play. They are interested without being excited;
       and their extraordinary self-control is particularly shown
       in various manifestations of the "Play-impulse." Everywhere
       the theatres are producing war dramas (based upon actual
       fact); the newspapers and magazines are publishing war
       stories and novels; the cinematograph exhibits the monstrous
       methods of modern warfare; and numberless industries are
       turning out objects of art or utility designed to
       commemorate the Japanese triumphs.</p>

    <p>But the present psychological condition, the cheerful and
    even playful tone of public feeling, can be indicated less by
    any general statement than by the mention of ordinary
    facts,&mdash;every-day matters recorded in the writer's
    diary.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Never before were the photographers so busy; it is said that
    they have not been able <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"
       id="page186"></a>[pg 186]</span> to fulfill half of the
       demands made upon them. The hundreds of thousands of men
       sent to the war wished to leave photographs with their
       families, and also to take with them portraits of parents,
       children, and other beloved persons. The nation was being
       photographed during the past six months.</p>

    <p>A fact of sociological interest is that photography has
    added something new to the poetry of the domestic faith. From
    the time of its first introduction, photography became popular
    in Japan; and none of those superstitions, which inspire fear
    of the camera among less civilized races, offered any obstacle
    to the rapid development of a new industry. It is true that
    there exists some queer-folk beliefs about
    photographs,&mdash;ideas of mysterious relation between the
    sun-picture and the person imaged. For example: if, in the
    photograph of a group, one figure appear indistinct or blurred,
    that is thought to be an omen of sickness or death. But this
    superstition has its industrial value: it has compelled
    photographers to be careful about their work,&mdash;especially
    in these days of war, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"
       id="page187"></a>[pg 187]</span> when everybody wants to
       have a good clear portrait, because the portrait might be
       needed for another purpose than preservation in an
       album.</p>

    <p>During the last twenty years there has gradually come into
    existence the custom of placing the photograph of a dead
    parent, brother, husband, or child, beside the mortuary tablet
    kept in the Buddhist household shrine. For this reason, also,
    the departing soldier wishes to leave at home a good likeness
    of himself.</p>

    <p>The rites of domestic affection, in old samurai families,
    are not confined to the cult of the dead. On certain occasions,
    the picture of the absent parent, husband, brother, or
    betrothed, is placed in the alcove of the guest-room, and a
    feast laid out before it. The photograph, in such cases, is
    fixed upon a little stand (<i>dai</i>); and the feast is served
    as if the person were present. This pretty custom of preparing
    a meal for the absent is probably more ancient than any art of
    portraiture; but the modern photograph adds to the human poetry
    of the rite. In feudal time it was the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"
       id="page188"></a>[pg 188]</span> rule to set the repast
       facing the direction in which the absent person had
       gone&mdash;north, south, east, or west. After a brief
       interval the covers of the vessels containing the cooked
       food were lifted and examined. If the lacquered inner
       surface was thickly beaded with vapor, all was well; but if
       the surface was dry, that was an omen of death, a sign that
       the disembodied spirit had returned to absorb the essence of
       the offerings.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>As might have been expected, in a country where the
    "play-impulse" is stronger, perhaps, than in any other part of
    the world, the Zeitgeist found manifestation in the flower
    displays of the year. I visited those in my neighborhood, which
    is the Quarter of the Gardeners. This quarter is famous for its
    azaleas (<i>tsutsuji</i>); and every spring the azalea gardens
    attract thousands of visitors,&mdash;not only by the wonderful
    exhibition then made of shrubs which look like solid masses of
    blossom (ranging up from snowy white, through all shades of
    pink, to a flamboyant purple) but also by displays
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
       id="page189"></a>[pg 189]</span> of effigies: groups of
       figures ingeniously formed with living leaves and flowers.
       These figures, life-size, usually represent famous incidents
       of history or drama. In many cases&mdash;though not in
       all&mdash;the bodies and the costumes are composed of
       foliage and flowers trained to grow about a framework; while
       the faces, feet, and hands are represented by some kind of
       flesh-colored composition.</p>

    <p>This year, however, a majority of the displays represented
    scenes of the war,&mdash;such as an engagement between Japanese
    infantry and mounted Cossacks, a night attack by torpedo boats,
    the sinking of a battleship. In the last-mentioned display,
    Russian bluejackets appeared, swimming for their lives in a
    rough sea;&mdash;the pasteboard waves and the swimming figures
    being made to rise and fall by the pulling of a string; while
    the crackling of quick-firing guns was imitated by a mechanism
    contrived with sheets of zinc.</p>

    <p>It is said that Admiral T&#333;g&#333; sent to
    T&#333;ky&#333; for some flowering-trees in pots&mdash;inasmuch
    as his responsibilities allowed him no
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"
       id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span> chance of seeing the
       cherry-flowers and the plum-blossoms in their
       season,&mdash;and that the gardeners responded even too
       generously.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Almost immediately after the beginning of hostilities,
    thousands of "war pictures"&mdash;mostly cheap
    lithographs&mdash;were published. The drawing and coloring were
    better than those of the prints issued at the time of the war
    with China; but the details were to a great extent
    imaginary,&mdash;altogether imaginary as to the appearance of
    Russian troops. Pictures of the engagements with the Russian
    fleet were effective, despite some lurid exaggeration. The most
    startling things were pictures of Russian defeats in Korea,
    published before a single military engagement had taken
    place;&mdash;the artist had "flushed to anticipate the scene."
    In these prints the Russians were depicted as fleeing in utter
    rout, leaving their officers&mdash;very fine-looking
    officers&mdash;dead upon the field; while the Japanese
    infantry, with dreadfully determined faces, were coming up at a
    double. The propriety and the wisdom of thus pictorially
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
       id="page191"></a>[pg 191]</span> predicting victory, and
       easy victory to boot, may be questioned. But I am told that
       the custom of so doing is an old one; and it is thought that
       to realize the common hope thus imaginatively is lucky. At
       all events, there is no attempt at deception in these
       pictorial undertakings;&mdash;they help to keep up the
       public courage, and they ought to be pleasing to the
       gods.</p>

    <p>Some of the earlier pictures have now been realized in grim
    fact. The victories in China had been similarly foreshadowed:
    they amply justified the faith of the artist.... To-day the war
    pictures continue to multiply; but they have changed character.
    The inexorable truth of the photograph, and the sketches of the
    war correspondent, now bring all the vividness and violence of
    fact to help the artist's imagination. There was something
    naïve and theatrical in the drawings of anticipation; but the
    pictures of the hour represent the most tragic
    reality,&mdash;always becoming more terrible. At this writing,
    Japan has yet lost no single battle; but not a few of her
    victories have been dearly
    won.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
       id="page192"></a>[pg 192]</span>

    <p>To enumerate even a tenth of the various articles ornamented
    with designs inspired by the war&mdash;articles such as combs,
    clasps, fans, brooches, card-cases, purses&mdash;would require
    a volume. Even cakes and confectionery are stamped with naval
    or military designs; and the glass or paper windows of
    shops&mdash;not to mention the signboards&mdash;have pictures
    of Japanese victories painted upon them. At night the shop
    lanterns proclaim the pride of the nation in its fleets and
    armies; and a whole chapter might easily be written about the
    new designs in transparencies and toy lanterns. A new revolving
    lantern&mdash;turned by the air-current which its own flame
    creates&mdash;has become very popular. It represents a charge
    of Japanese infantry upon Russian defenses; and holes pierced
    in the colored paper, so as to produce a continuous vivid
    flashing while the transparency revolves, suggest the exploding
    of shells and the volleying of machine guns.</p>

    <p>Some displays of the art-impulse, as inspired by the war,
    have been made in directions entirely unfamiliar to Western
    experience,&mdash;in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"
       id="page193"></a>[pg 193]</span> the manufacture, for
       example, of women's hair ornaments and dress materials.
       Dress goods decorated with war pictures have actually become
       a fashion,&mdash;especially crêpe silks for underwear, and
       figured silk linings for cloaks and sleeves. More remarkable
       than these are the new hairpins;&mdash;by hairpins I mean
       those long double-pronged ornaments of flexible metal which
       are called <i>kanzashi</i>, and are more or less ornamented
       according to the age of the wearer. (The <i>kanzashi</i>
       made for young girls are highly decorative; those worn by
       older folk are plain, or adorned only with a ball of coral
       or polished stone.) The new hairpins might be called
       commemorative: one, of which the decoration represents a
       British and a Japanese flag intercrossed, celebrates the
       Anglo-Japanese alliance; another represents an officer's cap
       and sword; and the best of all is surmounted by a tiny metal
       model of a battleship. The battleship-pin is not merely
       fantastic: it is actually pretty!</p>

    <p>As might have been expected, military and naval subjects
    occupy a large place among the year's designs for toweling. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span> towel designs celebrating
       naval victories have been particularly successful: they are
       mostly in white, on a blue ground; or in black, on a white
       ground. One of the best&mdash;blue and
       white&mdash;represented only a flock of gulls wheeling about
       the masthead of a sunken iron-clad, and, far away, the
       silhouettes of Japanese battleships passing to the
       horizon.... What especially struck me in this, and in
       several other designs, was the original manner in which the
       Japanese artist had seized upon the traits of the modern
       battleship,&mdash;the powerful and sinister lines of its
       shape,&mdash;just as he would have caught for us the typical
       character of a beetle or a lobster. The lines have been just
       enough exaggerated to convey, at one glance, the real
       impression made by the aspect of these iron
       monsters,&mdash;vague impression of bulk and force and
       menace, very difficult to express by ordinary methods of
       drawing.</p>

    <p>Besides towels decorated with artistic sketches of this
    sort, there have been placed upon the market many kinds of
    towels bearing comic war pictures,&mdash;caricatures or
    cartoons <span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"
       id="page195"></a>[pg 195]</span> which are amusing without
       being malignant. It will be remembered that at the time of
       the first attack made upon the Port Arthur squadron, several
       of the Russian officers were in the Dalny
       theatre,&mdash;never dreaming that the Japanese would dare
       to strike the first blow. This incident has been made the
       subject of a towel design. At one end of the towel is a
       comic study of the faces of the Russians, delightedly
       watching the gyrations of a ballet dancer. At the other end
       is a study of the faces of the same commanders when they
       find, on returning to the port, only the masts of their
       battleships above water. Another towel shows a procession of
       fish in front of a surgeon's office&mdash;waiting their
       turns to be relieved of sundry bayonets, swords, revolvers,
       and rifles, which have stuck in their throats. A third towel
       picture represents a Russian diver examining, with a
       prodigious magnifying-glass, the holes made by torpedoes in
       the hull of a sunken cruiser. Comic verses or legends, in
       cursive text, are printed beside these pictures.</p>

    <p>The great house of Mitsui, which
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"
       id="page196"></a>[pg 196]</span> placed the best of these
       designs on the market, also produced some beautiful
       souvenirs of the war, in the shape of <i>fukusa</i>. (A
       <i>fukusa</i> is an ornamental silk covering, or wrapper,
       put over presents sent to friends on certain occasions, and
       returned after the present has been received.) These are
       made of the heaviest and costliest silk, and inclosed within
       appropriately decorated covers. Upon one <i>fukusa</i> is a
       colored picture of the cruisers Nisshin and Kasuga, under
       full steam; and upon another has been printed, in beautiful
       Chinese characters, the full text of the Imperial
       Declaration of war.</p>

    <p>But the strangest things that I have seen in this line of
    production were silk dresses for baby girls,&mdash;figured
    stuffs which, when looked at from a little distance, appeared
    incomparably pretty, owing to the masterly juxtaposition of
    tints and colors. On closer inspection the charming design
    proved to be composed entirely of war pictures,&mdash;or,
    rather, fragments of pictures, blended into one astonishing
    combination: naval battles; burning warships; submarine mines
    exploding; torpedo boats attacking;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> charges of Cossacks
       repulsed by Japanese infantry; artillery rushing into
       position; storming of forts; long lines of soldiery
       advancing through mist. Here were colors of blood and fire,
       tints of morning haze and evening glow, noon-blue and
       starred night-purple, sea-gray and field-green,&mdash;most
       wonderful thing!... I suppose that the child of a military
       or naval officer might, without impropriety, be clad in such
       a robe. But then&mdash;the unspeakable pity of things!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The war toys are innumerable: I can attempt to mention only
    a few of the more remarkable kinds.</p>

    <p>Japanese children play many sorts of card games, some of
    which are old, others quite new. There are poetical card games,
    for example, played with a pack of which each card bears the
    text of a poem, or part of a poem; and the player should be
    able to remember the name of the author of any quotation in the
    set. Then there are geographical card games, in which each of
    the cards used bears the name, and perhaps a little picture, of
    some famous site, town, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"
       id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> or temple; and the player
       should be able to remember the district and province in
       which the mentioned place is situated. The latest novelty in
       this line is a pack of cards with pictures upon them of the
       Russian war vessels; and the player should be able to state
       what has become of every vessel named,&mdash;whether sunk,
       disabled, or confined in Port Arthur.</p>

    <p>There is another card game in which the battleships,
    cruisers, and torpedo craft of both Japan and Russia are
    represented. The winner in this game destroys his "captures" by
    tearing the cards taken. But the shops keep packages of each
    class of warship cards in stock; and when all the destroyers or
    cruisers of one country have been put <i>hors de combat</i>,
    the defeated party can purchase new vessels abroad. One torpedo
    boat costs about one farthing; but five torpedo boats can be
    bought for a penny.</p>

    <p>The toy-shops are crammed with models of
    battleships,&mdash;in wood, clay, porcelain, lead, and
    tin,&mdash;of many sizes and prices. Some of the larger ones,
    moved by clockwork, are named after Japanese battleships:
    Shikishima, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"
       id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> Fuji, Mikasa. One
       mechanical toy represents the sinking of a Russian vessel by
       a Japanese torpedo boat. Among cheaper things of this class
       is a box of colored sand, for the representation of naval
       engagements. Children arrange the sand so as to resemble
       waves; and with each box of sand are sold two fleets of tiny
       leaden vessels. The Japanese ships are white, and the
       Russian black; and explosions of torpedoes are to be figured
       by small cuttings of vermilion paper, planted in the
       sand.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The children of the poorest classes make their own war toys;
    and I have been wondering whether those ancient feudal laws
    (translated by Professor Wigmore), which fixed the cost and
    quality of toys to be given to children, did not help to
    develop that ingenuity which the little folk display. Recently
    I saw a group of children in our neighborhood playing at the
    siege of Port Arthur, with fleets improvised out of scraps of
    wood and some rusty nails. A tub of water represented Port
    Arthur. Battleships were figured by bits of plank, into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"
       id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> which chop-sticks had been
       fixed to represent masts, and rolls of paper to represent
       funnels. Little flags, appropriately colored, were fastened
       to the masts with rice paste. Torpedo boats were imaged by
       splinters, into each of which a short thick nail had been
       planted to indicate a smokestack. Stationary submarine mines
       were represented by small squares of wood, each having one
       long nail driven into it; and these little things, when
       dropped into water with the nail-head downwards, would keep
       up a curious bobbing motion for a long time. Other squares
       of wood, having clusters of short nails driven into them,
       represented floating mines: and the mimic battleships were
       made to drag for these, with lines of thread. The pictures
       in the Japanese papers had doubtless helped the children to
       imagine the events of the war with tolerable accuracy.</p>

    <p>Naval caps for children have become, of course, more in
    vogue than ever before. Some of the caps bear, in Chinese
    characters of burnished metal, the name of a battleship, or the
    words <i>Nippon Teikoku</i> (Empire of Japan),&mdash;disposed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"
       id="page201"></a>[pg 201]</span> like the characters upon
       the cap of a blue-jacket. On some caps, however, the ship's
       name appears in English letters,&mdash;Yashima, Fuji,
       etc.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The play-impulse, I had almost forgotten to say, is shared
    by the soldiers themselves,&mdash;though most of those called
    to the front do not expect to return in the body. They ask only
    to be remembered at the Spirit-Invoking Shrine
    (<i>Sh&#333;konsha</i>), where the shades of all who die for
    Emperor and country are believed to gather. The men of the
    regiments temporarily quartered in our suburb, on their way to
    the war, found time to play at mimic war with the small folk of
    the neighborhood. (At all times Japanese soldiers are very kind
    to children; and the children here march with them, join in
    their military songs, and correctly salute their officers,
    feeling sure that the gravest officer will return the salute of
    a little child.) When the last regiment went away, the men
    distributed toys among the children assembled at the station to
    give them a parting <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span> cheer,&mdash;hairpins, with
       military symbols for ornament, to the girls; wooden infantry
       and tin cavalry to the boys. The oddest present was a small
       clay model of a Russian soldier's head, presented with the
       jocose promise: "If we come back, we shall bring you some
       real ones." In the top of the head there is a small wire
       loop, to which a rubber string can be attached. At the time
       of the war with China, little clay models of Chinese heads,
       with very long queues, were favorite toys.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The war has also suggested a variety of new designs for that
    charming object, the <i>toko-niwa</i>. Few of my readers know
    what a <i>toko-niwa</i>, or "alcove-garden," is. It is a
    miniature garden&mdash;perhaps less than two feet
    square&mdash;contrived within an ornamental shallow basin of
    porcelain or other material, and placed in the alcove of a
    guest-room by way of decoration. You may see there a tiny pond;
    a streamlet crossed by humped bridges of Chinese pattern; dwarf
    trees forming a grove, and shading the model of a Shinto
    temple; imitations <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
       id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> in baked clay of stone
       lanterns,&mdash;perhaps even the appearance of a hamlet of
       thatched cottages. If the <i>toko-niwa</i> be not too small,
       you may see real fish swimming in the pond, or a pet
       tortoise crawling among the rockwork. Sometimes the
       miniature garden represents H&#333;rai, and the palace of
       the Dragon-King.</p>

    <p>Two new varieties have come into fashion. One is a model of
    Port Arthur, showing the harbor and the forts; and with the
    materials for the display there is sold a little map, showing
    how to place certain tiny battle-ships, representing the
    imprisoned and the investing fleets. The other <i>toko-niwa</i>
    represents a Korean or Chinese landscape, with hill ranges and
    rivers and woods; and the appearance of a battle is created by
    masses of toy soldiers&mdash;cavalry, infantry, and
    artillery&mdash;in all positions of attack and defense. Minute
    forts of baked clay, bristling with cannon about the size of
    small pins, occupy elevated positions. When properly arranged
    the effect is panoramic. The soldiers in the foreground are
    about an inch long; those a little farther away about
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> half as long; and those
       upon the hills are no larger than flies.</p>

    <p>But the most remarkable novelty of this sort yet produced is
    a kind of <i>toko-niwa</i> recently on display at a famous shop
    in Ginza. A label bearing the inscription, <i>Kaï-téï no
    Ikken</i> (View of the Ocean-Bed) sufficiently explained the
    design. The <i>suïbon</i>, or "water-tray," containing the
    display was half filled with rocks and sand so as to resemble a
    sea-bottom; and little fishes appeared swarming in the
    fore-ground. A little farther back, upon an elevation, stood
    Otohimé, the Dragon-King's daughter, surrounded by her maiden
    attendants, and gazing, with just the shadow of a smile, at two
    men in naval uniform who were shaking hands,&mdash;dead heroes
    of the war: Admiral Makaroff and Commander Hirosé!... These had
    esteemed each other in life; and it was a happy thought thus to
    represent their friendly meeting in the world of Spirits.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Though his name is perhaps unfamiliar to English readers,
    Commander Takeo Hirosé <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> has become, deservedly, one
       of Japan's national heroes. On the 27th of March, during the
       second attempt made to block the entrance to Port Arthur, he
       was killed while endeavoring to help a comrade,&mdash;a
       comrade who had formerly saved him from death. For five
       years Hirosé had been a naval attaché at St. Petersburg, and
       had made many friends in Russian naval and military circles.
       From boyhood his life had been devoted to study and duty;
       and it was commonly said of him that he had no particle of
       selfishness in his nature. Unlike most of his brother
       officers, he remained unmarried,&mdash;holding that no man
       who might be called on at any moment to lay down his life
       for his country had a moral right to marry. The only
       amusements in which he was ever known to indulge were
       physical exercises; and he was acknowledged one of the best
       <i>j&#363;jutsu</i> (wrestlers) in the empire. The heroism
       of his death, at the age of thirty-six, had much less to do
       with the honors paid to his memory than the self-denying
       heroism of his life.</p>

    <p>Now his picture is in thousands of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> homes, and his name is
       celebrated in every village. It is celebrated also by the
       manufacture of various souvenirs, which are sold by myriads.
       For example, there is a new fashion in sleeve-buttons,
       called <i>Kinen-botan</i>, or "Commemoration-buttons." Each
       button bears a miniature portrait of the commander, with the
       inscription, <i>Shichi-sh&#333; h&#333;koku</i>, "Even in
       seven successive lives&mdash;for love of country." It is
       recorded that Hirosé often cited, to friends who criticised
       his ascetic devotion to duty, the famous utterance of
       Kusunoki Masashigé, who declared, ere laying down his life
       for the Emperor Go-Daigo, that he desired to die for his
       sovereign in seven successive existences.</p>

    <p>But the highest honor paid to the memory of Hirosé is of a
    sort now possible only in the East, though once possible also
    in the West, when the Greek or Roman patriot-hero might be
    raised, by the common love of his people, to the place of the
    Immortals.... Wine-cups of porcelain have been made, decorated
    with his portrait; and beneath the portrait appears, in
    ideographs of gold, the inscription,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> <i>Gunshin Hirosé
       Ch&#363;sa</i>. The character "gun" signifies war; the
       character "<i>shin</i>" a god,&mdash;either in the sense of
       <i>divus</i> or <i>deus</i>, according to circumstances; and
       the Chinese text, read in the Japanese way, is <i>Ikusa no
       Kami</i>. Whether that stern and valiant spirit is really
       invoked by the millions who believe that no brave soul is
       doomed to extinction, no well-spent life laid down in vain,
       no heroism cast away, I do not know. But, in any event,
       human affection and gratitude can go no farther than this;
       and it must be confessed that Old Japan is still able to
       confer honors worth dying for.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Boys and girls in all the children's schools are now singing
    the Song of Hirosé Ch&#363;sa, which is a marching song. The
    words and the music are published in a little booklet, with a
    portrait of the late commander upon the cover. Everywhere, and
    at all hours of the day, one hears this song being
    sung:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><i>He whose every word and deed gave to men an example
        of what the war-folk of the</i>
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"
           id="page208"></a>[pg 208]</span> <i>Empire of Nippon
           should be,&mdash;Commander Hirosé: is he really
           dead?</i></p>

        <p><i>Though the body die, the spirit dies not. He who
        wished to be reborn seven times into this world, for the
        sake of serving his country, for the sake of requiting the
        Imperial favor,&mdash;Commander Hirosé: has he really
        died?</i></p>

        <p><i>"Since I am a son of the Country of the Gods, the
        fire of the evil-hearted Russians cannot touch
        me!"&mdash;The sturdy Takeo who spoke thus: can he really
        be dead?...</i></p>

        <p><i>Nay! that glorious war-death meant undying
        fame;&mdash;beyond a thousand years the valiant heart shall
        live;&mdash;as to a god of war shall reverence be paid to
        him....</i></p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />

    <p>Observing the playful confidence of this wonderful people in
    their struggle for existence against the mightiest power of the
    West,&mdash;their perfect trust in the wisdom of their leaders
    and the valor of their armies,&mdash;the good humor of their
    irony when mocking the enemy's blunders,&mdash;their strange
    capacity to find, in the world-stirring events of the hour,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
       id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span> the same amusement that
       they would find in watching a melodrama,&mdash;one is
       tempted to ask: "What would be the moral consequence of a
       national defeat?"... It would depend, I think, upon
       circumstances. Were Kuropatkin able to fulfill his rash
       threat of invading Japan, the nation would probably rise as
       one man. But otherwise the knowledge of any great disaster
       would be bravely borne. From time unknown Japan has been a
       land of cataclysms,&mdash;earth-quakes that ruin cities in
       the space of a moment; tidal waves, two hundred miles long,
       sweeping whole coast populations out of existence; floods
       submerging hundreds of leagues of well-tilled fields;
       eruptions burying provinces. Calamities like this have
       disciplined the race in resignation and in patience; and it
       has been well trained also to bear with courage all the
       misfortunes of war. Even by the foreign peoples that have
       been most closely in contact with her, the capacities of
       Japan remained unguessed. Perhaps her power to resist
       aggression is far surpassed by her power to endure.</p>

        <p>The last line alludes to a charming custom of which
        mention is made in the most ancient Japanese literature.
        Lovers, ere parting, were wont to tie each other's inner
        girdle (<i>himo</i>) and pledge themselves to leave the
        knot untouched until the time of their next meeting. This
        poem is said to have been composed in the seventh year of
        Y&#333;r&#333;,&mdash;A.D. 723,&mdash;eleven hundred and
        eighty-two years ago.</p>

        <p><i>Hisakata-no</i> is a "pillow-word" used by the old
        poets in relation to celestial objects; and it is often
        difficult to translate. Mr. Aston thinks that the literal
        meaning of <i>hisakata</i> is simply "long-hard," in the
        sense of long-enduring,&mdash;<i>hisa</i> (long),
        <i>katai</i> (hard, or firm),&mdash;so that
        <i>hisakata-no</i> would have the meaning of "firmamental."
        Japanese commentators, however, say that the term is
        composed with the three words, <i>hi</i> (sun), <i>sasu</i>
        (shine), and <i>kata</i> (side);&mdash;and this etymology
        would justify the rendering of <i>hisakata-no</i> by some
        such expression as "light-shedding," "radiance-giving." On
        the subject of pillow-words, see Aston's <i>Grammar of the
        Japanese Written Language</i>.</p>

        more than her face and the back of her head in the larger
        mirror: she sees her own double. The verses indicate that
        one of the mirrors may have caught the Shadow-Sickness, and
        doubled itself. And there is a further suggestion of the
        ghostly sympathy said to exist between a mirror and the

        <p>There is more weirdness in this poem than the above
        rendering suggests. The word <i>ukaman</i> in the fourth
        line can be rendered as "shall perhaps float," or as "shall
        perhaps be saved" (in the Buddhist sense of
        salvation),&mdash;as there are two verbs <i>ukami</i>.
        According to an old superstition, the spirits of the
        drowned must continue to dwell in the waters <i>until such
        time as they can lure the living to destruction</i>. When
        the ghost of any drowned person succeeds in drowning
        somebody, it may be able to obtain rebirth, and to leave
        the sea forever. The exclamation of the ghost in this poem
        really means, "Now perhaps I shall be able to drown
        somebody." (A very similar superstition is said to exist on
        the Breton coast.) A common Japanese saying about a child
        or any person who follows another too closely and
        persistently is: <i>Kawa de shinda-y&#363;réï no yona
        tsuré-hoshigaru!</i>&mdash;"Wants to follow you everywhere
        like the ghost of a drowned person."</p>

        <p>Here I cannot attempt to render the various plays upon
        words; but the term "<i>omoï</i>" needs explanation. It
        means "thought" or "thoughts;" but in colloquial
        phraseology it is often used as a euphemism for a dying
        person's last desire of vengeance. In various dramas it has
        been used in the signification of "avenging ghost." Thus
        the exclamation, "His <i>thought</i> has come
        back!"&mdash;in reference to a dead man&mdash;really means:
        "His angry ghost appears!"</p>

        <p>Shigéhira, after a brave fight in defense of the
        capital,&mdash;then held by the Taïra (or Héïké)
        party,&mdash;was surprised and routed by Yoshitsuné, leader
        of the Minamoto forces. A soldier named Iyénaga, who was a
        skilled archer, shot down Shigéhira's horse; and Shigéhira
        fell under the struggling animal. He cried to an attendant
        to bring another horse; but the man fled. Shigéhira was
        then captured by Iyénaga, and eventually given up to
        Yoritomo, head of the Minamoto clan, who caused him to be
        sent in a cage to Kamakura. There, after sundry
        humiliations, he was treated for a time with
        consideration,&mdash;having been able, by a Chinese poem,
        to touch even the cruel heart of Yoritomo. But in the
        following year he was executed by request of the Buddhist
        priests of Nanto, against whom he had formerly waged war by
        order of Kiyomori.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
